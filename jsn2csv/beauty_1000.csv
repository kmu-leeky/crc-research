I also use a silicone based primer,which works well for my skin type to give me the fresh, dewy look I love.You get a good amount of product for your money here, so this is well worth the cost.

I know, but hey, no other solution in sight), or better-still layer it if they decide to introduce its body lotion or body cream into the market.

I'm going to explain the ingredients . . .Yes you heard me . .the ingredients . . .Sure . .The /are/ listed here, but do you really know what they are . . .I'm not going to explain them all, but hopefully enough to help you understand the science of the scent as well as the actually scent itself. H'okay, here we go!*Centaurea Cyanus = the common Cornflower aka ""bluebottle"" aka the Buttonierre Flower*Squalene (which may or may not come from the bladder of a shark {most likely its just synthetically created now}) = a natural moisturizer. It penetrates the skin quickly, but does not leave that nasty greasy feeling (not to mention the fact that Squalene blends well with other oils and vitamins)*Glyercin is used to preserve the essential oils and chemicals from the herbs (aka the flowers) . . .it may also be used as a bonding agent.*Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis aka ""Sweet Almond"" (think Amaretto) is used to add a sweetness to the fragrance (durrr)*Cetyl Alcohol is the surfacant which is a wetting agent that allows easier spreading*Cetyl Palmitate is basically just an compound found in most oils . .*Gylceryl stearate is basically a lubricant . .It's used in all types of cosmetics . ..Mostly it comes from animal fat but it also can be obtainesd from some unsaturated vegetable oils (I'd check up on that . . .if you are an animal rights person or whatever . . )*Polysorbate 60 is used to solubilize essential oils into water-based products . . .*As for Dimethicone is mostly used is usually listed as a ""skin protectant"" whatever that means  . . . .*Jojoba oil is an exceptional moisturizer and more importantly, it's used in a lot of cosmetics as a replacement for whale oil (some scientists even claim it's superior to whale oil)*Tocopherol contains Vitamin E which is considered good for the skin :-)*shea butter is said to be a good skin softener . . .*Triethanolamine = a Ph balancer (makes sure the perfume/lotion/whatever isn't too acidic*Citronellol is an oil found in roses . . .It should be avoided by those who tend to have perfume allergies*linalool is a typical chemical found in many flowers and plants . .It also contains Vitamin E which is good . . .*Lavandula Stoechas is simply a type of lavander. it is commonly used in air fresheners and insecticides . . .*rosa gallica = a type of Rose*limomene = a hydrocarbon; you can thank the citris note in fragrance to this*There are multiple other flowers added to the mix so I would l put this fragrance in the flowery category . .As for some beaty tips considering this scent I'd say it's of moderate strength, it lasts around 8 hours or so, it's a casual scent . .not to fancy, but definitely far from plain; and I'd doubt a kid/teen would like the scent.

My fault, I was a newbie to the reviewer world and I failed to realize the importance of tried and true testing. 160 reviews later I get it. It took 3 different products and a very specific combination of products to achieve the texture that I was looking for.Me - 28 this month. V shaped hairline. Hairstyle - long enough to run a comb through, usually let it grow for 1.5 months then cut back.The Biotin B-Complex conditioner is a daily counterbalance to the Biotin Shampoo. The Shampoo is harsh but effective. It leaves my hair feeling like a brillo pad and the conditioner helps break that apart. When used together the signs of balding are significantly reduced (seeing your scalp through the hair). Also, my hairstyle is a lot easier and fuller looking (messy and pushed up in the front).Even with the combination I found my hair needing a break from the two. I use Organix Coconut milk conditioner once a week to soften my hair. This is an extremely effective break.The proportions I use suit my taste. The appearance of thickness is all I really care about. I know i'll go bald eventually which is why i'm putting the work in the gym now. You have to be in shape if you're bald :)",4.0,Gives the appearance of thicker hair.,1356393600,"12 25, 2012"

AQX8T9SFFK43U,B00004TMFE,Kristina Montes,"[3, 4]","6/8/2013, first review: I thought to review this product as time goes on. I've only been using it for a week, so I do not expect to see hair growth at this point.  It's good to note that I'm 42 years old, w/disturbing hair loss.The bottles are SMALL so I'm not using it carelessly. The smell is not flowery & fun, but it's more medicinal in scent, not overpowering. The shampoo lathers if you work at it, & it's a low lather rather than a high and luffy one. I rub it gently on my scalp & throughout my hair. If scrub too hard, I'll lose MORE HAIR. :( I am washing my hair every day, where I used to wash every other day. The conditioner does not lather.  It's more of a cream that I rub gently onto wet hair. My hair feels sort of weighty as I wash it & I think that I'm going to have a BAD HAIR DAY ahead of me, but after styling, it's actually soft, manageable, not weighty! After washing, I wrap in a towel for about 5 minutes, apply FINESSE styling mousse, let my brown curls air dry. Sometimes a touch of hairspray but most days, not. With the thick feel in the shower, I am surprised that it's not weighted down after styling. SO, I'll keep on trying this for 3 months. I'll try to remember to update if I see a difference. Feel free to ask me questions.**IT'S IMPORTANT TO MENTION THAT ALONG W/THE SHAMPOO & CONDITIONER, I'M TAKING, MAXI HAIR SUPPLEMENTS.  My Dr. was pleased w/the ingredients of the shamp, cond AND supplements. I use the supplements in place of a multi so I also take OMEGA 3 & Calcium Citrate w/ D3. (As per Dr).**6/27/2013 - Although there is NO new hair growth, I've noticed that I'M LOSING LESS HAIR when I wash & style!  It's enough for me to notice & enough for me to keep going w/ this trial. 19 days in, w/ consistent use of shamp/cond & Maxi Hair, my hair is smoother, softer, shinier stronger, doesn't have a bad smell, still not weighty & continues to be manageable. I feel like whatever residue was clogging my hair is out. My hope is that this is the case for my scalp & maybe, just maybe, I'll see some new sprouts. A girl can dream. :)6/30/2013 - Could it be?  New hair?  Will keep you posted.  I see three short hairs poking through!  I should also note that my nails need to be trimmed more often than ever, and I have to shave, (legs, underarms), more frequently!  I suspect this would be from the internal good I'm getting from the Maxi-Hair supplement.7/21/2013 - YES!  Still losing less hair, AND there IS new hair growth in little stray spots.  My nails, which I keep short, need to be cut once every week to 10 days as opposed to once every 3 or more weeks!  I rcvd two complements on my hair this past week, about how shiny &healthy; it looks!  I remain faithful to the products, using them EVERY DAY as recommended.9/21/13 - IMPORTANT UPDATE.  It seems that with months of use, this product is GREAT for clearing up any residue on my scalp, BUT it is drying out my hair.  I have to rotate my use of this and the conditioner.  It's stripping the oils from my hair.  I will still use the shampoo and conditioner, but may just use it once a week.  WIll keep updating.  I did notice that for the past two weeks, when I use the products, my scalp gets just a little itchy.  That also indicates to me that the residue blocking my pores may be cleared up!  That is the good part!  SO, I will be using the MAXI HAIR daily as bottle recommends, but will limit the use of the shampoo and conditioner.",4.0,Losing less hair!

A1ACH77RG6C8MN,B00004TMFE,VirtualGrace,"[0, 0]","I was so very disappointed with my purchase of the Avalon Thickening shampoo and conditioner. I had such high hopes, but in only two shampooings, my hair was noticeably stripped of oils, had that &#34;squeaky clean&#34; feeling you get when using a very harsh product, and it became dry and brittle. It started looking very dull. They use many products that have an oil stripping effect on the hair, like orange oil and lemon oil. You might think because it says, 'oil' that it might add to your hair's shine, but these are ingredients in industrial strength degreasers. This product only damaged my hair. Avalon is only 70% organic and it had a rather unpleasant smell to me. Rather like mosquito repellant or dish soap. Using a harsh product like this is very detrimental for your hair. I know that a lot of people will be drawn to Avalon because of the low price, but if it drastically stripped my extremely oily hair in two shampoos, I can't imagine what it might do to yours. Although my hair is very fine, so perhaps ethnic girls, and women with coarser hair might benefit? I honestly wouldn't recommend it. I'd rather see people get something that will improve their self-esteem immediately, rather than give them new problems to worry about.In desperation I purchased the more expensive Just Naturals system for thinning hair and believe me, it blows Avalon out of the water. In just one shampoo my hair regained it's texture and became so silky it felt like Asian hair. I can't stop touching my hair now and I feel so much more confident. They use incredible ingredients that greatly benefit people with hair loss due to hormonal issues, or who have an increase in DHT. You do pay more than double for that shampoo, but having something that supports your hair, improves the texture, and smells fantastic, was worth it to me. I'm now quite confident in what I'm using and plan to go on using it, regardless of the cost. I'd pay 5x what I'm paying for it now, I love it so much. And their treatment spray is oil based. I use the system twice a day and I'm shocked at how long it is lasting. It has truly been an excellent investment.I would recommend that you shampoo and condition your hair twice a day if you want to see regrowth with any system. This is because one application of shampoo with DHT-fighting ingredients, can only do so much. Your body is constantly generating new hormones and new DHT. By helping to combat it twice a day, you have a better chance of seeing results sooner. This is coming from a 36 year old woman who has been fighting repeated hair loss due to hormonal imbalance from 16 on. Once a day just never cut it for me. Using a leave on treatment like Just Naturals has overnight, can also work wonders. I use it during the day too if I'm not going out.I hope this helps you recover your hair, and your self-esteem, a little faster and more efficiently. :o)",2.0,"Industrial strength degreaser.

So why, you ask did I buy a second one???  Because one day recently as soon as I'd begun to lift the lid to check the level of soap in the bottles, one of them slipped out onto the shower floor and shattered into about 100 pieces.  I'd clearly seated it in properly the last time I took it out or else the lid wouldn't have closed in the first place.  Also, the unit was never bumped, jostled or anything else that would have caused the bottle to come loose.  So...manufacturing defect?  I think so.Anyway, I ended up contacting Better Living to ask about a replacement bottle and was hoping for a courteous, &#34;we'll send you one free of charge since it's our crappy product's fault.&#34;  Instead, I was directed to a link on their website where you can purchase replacement parts (this is likely where they make most of their money).  At over $5 for a cheap plastic bottle that I now know will shatter if dropped three feet, I was loath to buy one but basically had no choice.  I added it to my cart and during checkout found out that they don't ship to military APO addresses (which have California zip codes, BTW).  I contacted the company and told them about my dilemma and they basically told me to get lost.  Customer service really IS dead.So now here I am writing a glowing review of the entirely new dispenser I had to purchase just so that I could get a replacement bottle for my soap and have some spare ones for when the others inevitably break.

ABFAO09KLTIFL,B00004TUBL,R. Reviewer,"[0, 0]","I installed this thing about a week ago. Overall, very positive. I have a variety of liquids in it, and two are actually very thick. I had no problem priming the thing and getting it going, so even the thick stuff pumps out smoothly, without any issues. As far as mounting goes, the silicon they provided was hardened and fairly useless, only got a little bit out. Luckily, I had a tube of rubber adhesive (similar to the silicon, but a bit thinner), which worked fine to attach the plastic base of the unit to the uneven ceramic tile of my shower wall. It is on there solid, and not going anywhere. I have used the silicon type adhesive with another product (aDeluxe LED Fogless Shower Mirror with Squeegee by ToiletTree Products. Guaranteed Not to Fog, Designed Not to Fall. 20% Larger Than Our #1 Selling Original Mirror.I ordered here on amazon) and it works equally well. Of course they have not been time-tested, but this method is a heck of a lot better then suction cups. In terms of getting the things off when/if the time comes, I can't help ya there, but others in these reviews have mentioned product that can clean off the adhesive residue from tile. If I have to take these down at some point, it will probably be just to replace them. I am not renting, so I don't have to worry about that.I was pleasantly surprised to find the claims about saving soap/shampoo to be very true. I use a lot less with this dispenser then when squirting directly from the bottle. A few pumps get you going, then an occasional pump to keep the lather going. It's much easier to control, because less comes out with each pump of the dispenser, but I want to emphasize, it is in NO WAY inconvenient or difficult to get enough soap out with quickly with a few pumps-- faster then messing with the bottles themselves or with bar soap for that matter.I got the white plastic, which I am sure will discolor over time, as does almost all white plastic-- but that is just a guess, and I don't really care.I give it 4 our of 5 because of the silicon issue (and if I didn't have any lying around the house, and had to order some more and wait on it, I might have been irritated enough to bump another star-- but that would be unfortunate, because it really is a great product, even if you need to order your own adhesive).Conclusion: highly recommend, no reservations!",4.0,Works great.,1321142400,"11 13, 2011"

If you use a liquid makeup, this will probably not be an issue.  With other forms of makeup, it might not blend as well as you would like.

Don't spend a bunch of money on an eyeliner that promises to be good.  Ultraliner is actually great.  I'm not sure what the formula is, but it stays on kind of like a permanent glove.  It was even snowing and blowing in my face making my eyes water really bad, but when I looked the eyeliner did not run and was still on.  I tried it on my hand and noticed that it dries right away.  It dries to a material that can actually kind of be peeled off as needed.  If you try to rub it, it won't come off.  It did not really budge with water either.  Amazingly you can still take it off when you are ready.  It does not run in your eye and I noticed unlike some eyeliners that get all over your lower lashes causing marks under your eye, Ultra Liner does not do that.  I've had this eyeliner a long time and it still works.  You may just want to clean the wand off though to prevent a sticky buildup.  I've had more expensive liners that were just terrible.

There are several good things about this product but a couple of negatives that bring my rating down a notch.Pros:*Long lasting.  It stays on all day, from morning until night*No flaking, peeling, fading, or smudging.  It stays exactly how you applied it and doesn't give you racoon eyes.*The color is so rich, black, and dark.  The color really makes my eyes pop and gives them that extra oomph.*It dries quickly and doesn't feel wet on your eye lids.*It's affordable and you seem to get a lot of product for the price.Cons:*It is somewhat difficult to remove at night.  I use makeup remover and I have to rub at it a little more than I do with other eyeliners to remove it completely.*It is a little difficult to apply in the sense that not a lot of product gets onto the brush to transfer to your lids.  I have to screw the cap on, shake it, and then remove the brush about 3-4 times to get the look I'm going for.  I don't know if I just got an old produt or if the formula is drier because it's waterproof (I think that's the reason), but it's not a huge deal unless you only have a little bit of time to apply this liner.Overall, this is a good liner that gives a dark, dramatic color and stays on all day without flaking or smudging.  I found it to be a little difficult to apply and remove at night and had to spend a little bit more effort doing this than I've had to do with other liners.

The consistency of the eyeliner itself isn't too liquidy or goopy... it's a great thickness. I've used this eyeliner for a couple years now, on and off, to line my top lid and do a bit of a wing.Here's where things were iffy: after a couple of hours, the eyeliner would crack. It wouldn't smudge or bleed. It would CRACK. By the end of the day, if I hadn't reapplied it, there would be breaks in what was once a lovely smooth line. I didn't need a makeup remover wipe to take it off, I could practically peel it off. Weird!! Was it my eye? Was it the liner? I determined eventually that 95% of it was caused by the fact that the bottle of liner I was using was OLD. Like, several years old. I knew it was old from the start, but it was an otherwise great liner, so I continued to use it. It wasn't until I bought a new bottle recently that I figured this out. The new stuff will still crack occasionally in small amounts if I wear it for a long time and I guess scrunch my eyes up a lot, but nowhere near the amount it used to.The brush is advertised as tapered but it's not as tapered as I would have expected. It still has bristles; it isn't a triangular foam brush.It is indeed waterproof from personal experience.Overall, pretty good eyeliner, at least compared to some other liquid eyeliners I've tried as of late.

It worked for me but there were no 'instant' improvements. In my case the itchiness went away VERY slowly but, 3 months later, it's 99% gone.I'm not sure what the exact problem my scalp had but it was itchy like... you know what. It began about one year ago and I couldn't stop myself from scratching which, of course, ensured that my scalp stayed itchy and irritated. Discussing the problem with our good family doctor back in October or November (7-8 months ago) did not help much. He had nothing to prescribe but suggested that I massage my scalp with cortisone cream - messy because I have a fully head of hair and I am not planning to shave it - and predicting that the itchiness will get worse in the winter. (Thank you doc!)To make the story short, a couple of months ago I stumbled upon a bottle of T/Gel left over from the time I used it (effectively) to address a dandruff problem and decided to give it a try. The box claims that this is 'effective from the first use'. It's not. My scalp was still itchy one month later but maybe not as much. And... a couple of weeks ago I just noticed - I wasn't scratching or massaging my head any more. The itch was largely gone.I can't say that the T/Gel cured me and it's quite possible that the itchiness would come back if I stopped using it. Maybe I will experiment with that in a couple of months but, at this time, I am content and happy to have it at least under control with one weekly T/Gel use. Yes, it smells a little funny but if you use it before going to bed the smell should be gone by morning.The product deserves my 5 stars because it worked for me. It's possible that it doesn't work for everyone but I can't see how trying it would hurt.____________________________________NOTE: about the smell.The active ingredient that addresses itching and flaking is 'coal tar' which is smelly. Neutrogena has patented something they call NEUTAR which is a more refined version of coal tar that doesn't smell as bad as the traditional ingredient.

When I was younger, my head would itch so bad, I would sometimes scratch to the point my scalp would bleed. As I got older, I learned to only wear light colored tops and buy light colored coats and jackets so that my flakes wouldn't be so overt.One day I went to the doctor for a sinus infection and while I was there I asked him what he recommended for my dandruff - thinking he would write a prescription for radioactive kryptonite or something expensive that would turn my hair green.  The doctor said, ""Neutrogena T-Gel."" I asked, ""Is that a prescription?"" ""No,"" he replied. I was stunned. I had used Head and Shoulders, Selson Blue and just about everything else on the market - how would this be different? The doctor was persistent and emphasized that T-Gel should work, so I gave it a shot.This stuff has been a life-saver. It's not very glamorous looking - brown, weird smelling shampoo - but just a dollup the size of a nickel is all I need to lather up my entire head - and I have very thick, curly hair.  The longer you let it sit on your scalp, the better - 3 minutes is ideal. Despite the unusual smell from the bottle, your hair just smells fresh and clean.Unlike other shampoos, I have never had to take a ""vacation"" and use another shampoo to ""liven up"" my hair. T-Gel is pretty basic stuff - no perfumes or weird chemicals - the active ingredient, Coal Tar, is a byproduct from the coal processing industry and this gives it its dark color.  I have used T-Gel for almost 15 years now and I never have flakes and I probably scratch my head 3 times a year. About 30% of my hair is now white and silver and I have not had a problem with the shampoo discoloring it.Once in a while I will get free shampoo samples in the mail and use other shampoos, but just after 2 hair washings w/o T-Gel, my scalp will start itching again.  It seems expensive when you see the price, but one bottle usually lasts me for 3-4 months since you only need a little dab.When I used to color my hair, I used a conditioner for colored hair and it didn't seem to cancel out the effects of T-Gel... and after my hair is dry, I use yet another brand of mousse and a hair serum to style my hair - and still, no itching.If you have dandruff and haven't tried T-Gel, just give it a try - in one week, you should be symptom free!",5.0,works wonders!,1071619200,"12 17, 2003"

Many of the reviewers mentioned this product's ability to deal with their itchy and often oily scalp. This was my concern too. A huge benefit I noticed right away was that it made my hair (not my scalp) feel really really clean- it would even squeak when I would squeeze out the water, post-shower. So, I was excited about how well it worked and how quickly.But I noticed within a day of using it that I now had a problem I never had before: flakes! So many of them, and so disgustingly visible! Further, after a day of washing, my scalp got extremely oily- more so than it did before. Still, I've been using it and giving it a chance, at least until I am done with this entire (small) bottle.I am about half way through the bottle, washing my hair every other day, and have experienced the same results consistently.

After discontinuing Dove her skin has mostly cleared up and she no longer itches.I wondered if the detergent (surfuctant) base in most baby shampoos could be triggering a similar response. I knew dandruff shampoos were sometimes recommended for cradle cap in babies, so I tried a small amount (quarter size) ofNeutrogena T/Sal Shampoo, Scalp Build-up Control, 4.5 fl ozon her, left it on for five minutes, rinsed well and reapplied, leaving it on for another five minutes. I thought her curly hair would be a dry frizzy mess but was surprised when it dried and it was very soft and wavy; a dime size dab ofAveeno Baby Eczema Therapy Moisturizing Cream, 5 Ounceworked through her hair and scalp, a spray of water and some scrunching is all that's needed to form ringlets that hold all day. Her scalp cleared up in less than a week, and although she isn't cured - it comes back if I don't use it on her -  I'm glad to finally have found a solution.I use T-Sal once or twice a week on her, if any scales reappear - otherwise, I useBella B Bee Gone Cradle Cap Baby Shampoo 8 Oz. This shampoo is aloe based, hypoallergenic and paraben free, with a light fragrance that hasn't caused any issues. Both shampoos have worked well on my other children who sometimes get cradle cap as well.On my end, I am sensitive to fragrances and my hair reacts terribly to strong sulfuctants and silicones found in ""hydrating"" shampoos, causing a huge amount of frizz, dryness, build up and breakage. Before trying T-Sal on my children, I tried it on my wavy hair. I was also surprised to see how well T-Sal cleaned and how soft and light feeling my hair dried afterwards. I've also noticed it helps my hand eczema (from using strong detergents such asDial 1423982 Purex Ultra Free and Clear Concentrated Liquid Detergent, 100oz Bottle, (Pack of 4)), if I leave the shampoo on my hands as long as I do on my hair.I now use T-Sal to help remove product build up and alternate withDHS Clear Shampoo 16 ozandDHS Conditioning Rinse with Panthenol, Fragrance Free 8 fl oz (236 ml), both very mild no-frills products that work really well.The only thing I don't like is the small size.

I gradually lost 56 pounds and lowered my blood sugar levels, and my cholesterol levels dramatically.Since that time I went off of it, returned to my bad ways of eating, regained the weight, and blood sugar and cholesterol went way up again.For the past several months I have once again been taking fiber supplements. I had been taking Konjac Glucommanan Powder and have been very pleased with it. But, I decided to try Konsyl again since I can just go to the store and buy it instead of ordering online.I do not like taking the Konsyl as well as I like the Konjac Glucomannan. And, there is some differences in the two fibers. Konjac Glucomannan is solely a soluable fiber (which will more effectively lower your cholesterol), while Konsyl is a mixture of both soluable fiber and non-soluable fiber (the non-soluable fiber helps 'sweet' your colon and creates faster transit, while the soluable fiber lowers the cholesterol but doesn't increase the speed of transit).So, if your transit time is too fast you may want to look more at taking Konjac Glucomannan. But, if your transit time is too slow Konsyl would be better. If you want (more) lowering of cholesterol than Konjac Glucomannan would be the way to go. If you want faster transit along with cholesterol lowering than Konsyl is the way to go.I have decided to alternate using both products; one product at one meal, the other product at the other meal. So, alternating both products should give me the best of both.Konjac Glucomannan sticks to the side of the glass if you don't mix and drink fast enough, but it goes down smoothe. But, there also is a slightly odd flavor to Konjac Glucomannan. Konsyl is a pretty much flavorless fiber, but has gritty path down that I really don't care for.

I have tried every. single. lotion/acne-clearer possibly available on the market from the time I was 13 (I am now 22). To make that search all the more difficult, I am incredibly SENSITIVE skin... the kind where I have to be careful to wash my bedsheets with odor-free detergent. Sometimes when putting on shirts (that I wash with a nicely scented detergent) if it touches the side of my face it begins to itch and then I have an allergic reaction in that very spot. I am *that* sensitive. Hence, most of the ""Guaranteed"" products out there made me face swell up like a red water-balloon literally (Proactiv).I don't know the technical term, but I suffer from a vicissitude of extremely dry & extremely oily skin. My chin and lower half of my cheeks and around my mouth get extremely dry, peel, itch, and then if I itch form red spots, etc. I stress all this as I find it EXTREMELY important when giving this product the review I'm going to give it.To not digress further, I went to my dermatologist and decided not to use Acutane due to the risks, and was put on Monodox ""as needed"". When I'm breaking out badly, I take one for 2-3 days consecutively and then stop for about a week and repeat the process. So, this is my explanation to explain my acne condition.As far as MOISTURIZER, I've been so desperate to find the right moisturizer that would help give me that 'soothing' feeling versus itching, stinging, or masking my face with oil. If it stung, it would end up itching after a while, and hence make my condition worse, not better. If it simply felt like a 'masked' feeling in the face, then it simply did absolutely nothing for me and didn't help the dryness at all.This is the ONE and ONLY topical product I have ever used that's helped me. Not only have I found the absolute perfect moisterizer, but for my personal skin condition, it truly does all it states. I *LOVE* the tingly clean feeling! It's like having mint on your face and walking outside on a cool, crisp morning. It has 0 oil. None. I leave it on for hours and it's perfect.

I did a lot of research and found this to be the best B.P. product on the market. It is 2.5% B.P and this is the amount you need in a product, if you go over that it is much too harsh for your skin (especially mine because it is sensitive). Obviously if you have severe acne and need medication type products, that might be different for you. But for the average face, anything over 2.5% B.P is much too harsh. I actually don't buy this product on Amazon I just buy it at my local WalMart and it is about the same price on Amazon, minus the shipping charge. I'd say it's a pricey little product for the small tube you are getting, especially the way I use it all over my face but, hey it works and that's why I stick to it. The other two products I use last months and aren't that expensive for how long they last so I can afford to use this product. While it says it is an ""On the spot"" treatment, I actually use it all over my face. Because it is not a gel and it is creamy, you can't really apply it all over your face then rub it in, you'll have to apply a small amount to your finger and apply in batches. I don't find this annoying or hard to do, though some might because it takes a bit longer. When I first started using this product I only applied a small amount to my face in certain spots to get my skin used to it. Progressively over 2 weeks I began to use more and more and my skins takes it like a champ now. Even though it is a B.P. product, I actually don't get the stiff feeling after applying it all over my face. It also does not leave a white residue as other creamy products might do, it is a little difficult to work in if you're using small amounts but it goes on well. I find that it clears my skin up well but of course I get an occasional pimple or so due to that time of the month or stress or whatever, but much less than I used to!

How I use it: Put about a nickle sized dollop on my fingertips and rub it into my face, then gently rinse by wiping off with a warm soft washcloth. I often put my face under the shower faucet for a brief 2-3 second rinse after that, too, which I know many skincare professionals discourage, but I find I get a better rinse that way, especially in the area where my face meets my hair.Basis is a thinnish gel consistency which feels great to the touch, and has a wonderful scent. It cleans well, though I found it wasn't very good at taking off makeup. For days when I don't wear makeup, it's just fine, but when trying to take off the usual foundation and powder, some was always left behind and I had to grab a second cleanser. For the usual oil, dust, etc., though, it's good.There's a slick feeling to the skin after you use it, which doesn't come off no matter how much you rinse. I wasn't fond of that at first but have come to get used to it. That alone was enough to make me decide not to buy a second bottle.But the biggest problem was for the more delicate skin under and around my eyes. I'm 42 so my under-eye skin has definitely had changes since I was younger, and it's much less able to take a strong cleanser. Basis left red patches in the under-eye area near the nose, and though moisturizer helped, there were dry flakes left behind. Even if it looked okay at a glance, when I put makeup on it was very noticeable. I avoid that area now and it's all good -- my forehead, chin and nose were the oiliest parts anyway -- but unless your entire face is oily, this may not be the cleanser for you.I'm a little disappointed because the price, the consistency and the scent are perfect, but there are just too many cons for me to buy a second time.",3.0,"terrific scent, consistency and cleaning, too harsh on skin",1397865600,"04 19, 2014"

I mean, part of the Cetaphil brand's selling point is that its skincare products have no fragrance added to them that would irritate sensitive skin. So why does this Cetaphil product have any fragrance at all?I usually have no problems with lightly-scented skincare products, provided they are only LIGHTLY scented. I'm fortunate not to have sensitive or allergic skin reactions to fragrance ingredients, but I still have to avoid most of them because for me, strong perfumes set off major migraines. Other than that, some of the scents in skincare products are actually quite nice. But this...

I'm a Florida native with blonde hair and fair skin, so after a lifetime of sun my face had issues with some sunspots and a blotchy complexion.  I don't have problems with breakouts and only have a few faint ""laugh line"" wrinkles that I'm not worried about yet so this review won't address those issues.Since I can't afford constant facials I did some research and developed my own skin-care regimen.  Exfoliating dead skin cells is important so I decided an AHA product would be useful and ordered this creme and began using it most nights after washing my face.  I leave it on anywhere from 10 minutes to an hour and then use an eye cream and moisturizing lotion.  I had some very mild tingling the first time I used it but nothing after that - if you have sensitive skin you might want to try the 8% version first and work your way up to the 10%.After doing this for about 6 weeks I can see a definite difference in my skin that can't be attributed to just the moisturizing.  The sunspots are still there (and always will be) but they are much, much lighter and less noticeable.  The blotchiness has evened out considerably and I feel like I could run up to the store without makeup and not worry about frightening small children.  [...smile...]  As I said, I don't have much in the way of wrinkles so I really haven't noticed whether this has done anything to clear them up or not.

I learned years ago when I first started using it that the best concentration for an alpha hydroxy acid (AHA) is between 8% to 12% and the ideal pH is 3 to 4. You can use a pH test strip to check the pH. The Alpha Hydrox cream has a concentration of 10 and a pH of 4. The souffle works well too but the cream is cheaper and works exactly the same. I've tried other alpha hydroxy acids in the past with a higher concentration of AHA but the pH was too high to make it effective. The higher the pH, the greater the buffer and that reduces the strength of the AHA and renders it useless. I've been using this brand for years although I've occasionally tried others.

For night use if my skin feels dry, I sometimes apply some Alpha Hydrox nourishing night creme (it doesn't contain AHAs).I'm not sure if this does much for lines and wrinkles- first, I don't have many, and I haven't used this long enough, but this creme does a wonderful job for dry skin with patches, and for uneven skin, through faster renewal, and dead skin cell removal.I definitely recommend this product, it's a great, truly effective creme, and you can't really beat the price!",5.0,"for thos who want clear, smooth skin!",1343433600,"07 28, 2012"

AK7CAW3N1XZV6,B000052YM7,"Beth Cholette ""doctor_beth""","[15, 19]","I waited a LONG time before writing this review because I wanted to be REALLY sure that this product was working for me.  At first, I was using it along with another product in the Alpha Hydrox line,Alpha Hydrox AHA Souffle 12% Glycolic AHA 1.6 oz (45 g), and experiencing problems--it turns out that I was sold a container of the Souffle that was actually several years old.  Whatever the cause, I stopped using the Souffle and have been using only the Enhanced Lotion alone for a few months now, and my skin is looking better than it has in years!!!First, a little background information about me.  I am currently in my early 40s.  As a teen, I had very oily skin but only mild acne problems.  In my late 20s/early 30s, however, I began to experience increasing issues with adult acne.  Although the problem wasn't severe, it was quite persistent and recurrent.  I actually went to two different dermatologists and tried various tropical and oral medications with little success.  (The only thing that really worked was Accutane, but that became WAY too cumbersome to continue to use given all of the requirements surrounding prescribing it.)After that, I experimented with using various over-the-counter products, always with mixed results.  More recently, I began doing some reading on alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs).  I did a lot of research of various products both here on Amazon and on the web site Makeup Alley, and after my failed experiment with the Alpha Hydrox Souffle mentioned above, I decided to try this product, the 10% Enhanced Lotion.  I am amazed by the results!  Within only a week or two of discontinuing the Souffle (which made my skin break out even worse) and using the Enhanced Lotion alone, my skin was MUCH clearer.Now, after using this product daily for about two months, my skin looks great: NO blemishes!  I do occasionally get a small pimple or two (usually around the same time in my menstrual cycle), but when that happens, they fade very quickly, leaving no scarring behind.  Also, I am starting to notice that the old acne scars I had from before I started using the Enhanced Lotion are FINALLY starting to fade as well--that is taking longer, but it IS happening.I use this product twice a day.  You only need a very small amount, as it is thin and spreads easily over the entire face.  At night, I will apply the product slightly more generously.  (It definitely does sting a bit; this occurs with all AHAs.  You can minimize this effect by applying less or trying a moisturizer on top.)  In the morning, I will use only a tiny amount of the product (or sometimes skip it altogether), and on top, I will use Olay Complete Lotion for Combination Skin with SPF 15 - 6 oz., which contains a beta-hydroxy acid (BHA; salicylic acid) and also SPF, which is important when using AHAs because of increased sun sensitivity.  This combination seems to be working well for me.  I haven't really needed much extra night-time moisturization given both that it is summer and that my skin tends to be more on the oily side anyway, but when I do, I have been usingSt. Ives Fresh Skin Collagen Elastin Facial Moisturizer 10 oz (283 g).I am thrilled to have found a skin care regime that is not only working for me but also consists of very affordable products.  Definitely, this Enhanced Lotion by Alpha Hydrox is the cornerstone of my routine, and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it highly!",5.0,FINALLY a product to help with my adult acne!,1279843200,"07 23, 2010"

My face did sting for about 10 minutes, and then I applied heavy moisturizer over it, and the stinging sensation subsided.  I really liked the way my skin looked this morning.  It looked brighter, and my face had less redness.  I think I might be using too much of this product; a little goes a long way, and I usually apply about a dimes worth to my face and, and I feel it may be overkill.  I sort of like how it makes my skin red initially; it gives me some color, almost like I was in the sun, but a healthy color, not like Retin-A red, where it's splotchy and sickly looking.  I hope this product doesn't break my sensitive skin out, but I will update when more time has passed.  I'm using this on alternate days with Retin-A cream (both at night before bed), as I have read several places that these two products work well if you use them on alternate days.  I have very delicate skin, and I can only tolerate Retin-A twice a week, or I get a lot of irritation and redness (not cute redness either).I used to put lemon juice on my face a few times a week, and this AHA cream feels exactly how the lemon juice felt, so I wasn't alarmed.  Lemons work great, but they are sort of messy and gross, and I don't like the way it feels on my skin while I'm sleeping.  Lemons are incredible for brightening my complexion, but it appears that this AHA lotion has the same effect; yay! :)UPDATE: I have been using this now for a few weeks, and I really like the results.  I put it on after I wash my face at night, and then put a heavy moisturizing cream on after it.  My skin definitely looks brighter and makeup goes on much smoother.  Just make sure that you are exfoliating your skin by washing.  I wash twice a day, once in the morning in the shower, and then at night.  I don't use a wash cloth to wash, because that is too harsh for the delicate skin. I just use my hands and gentle pressure and wash for 1 entire minute.

My arms and legs are especially affected by the spots and I've been self-conscious about them for years.  I've been very happy with the Alpha Hydrox cream for my face so I decided to try the lotion on my arms and legs.I've been using it now for about 6 weeks and the change in my skin's appearance is fantastic!  The spots will never go away, but they are much, much fainter and less noticeable.  Overall the skin is smoother and softer and just looks and feels much better.I use this most evenings, putting it on my arms and legs while I watch TV.  I wait anywhere from 10 minutes to an hour and then put on a regular moisturizing lotion.  I've read warnings that the AHA will cause the skin to be more susceptible to sunburning, so I've been careful to use a body lotion with SPF 15 every morning since starting this routine.  I have no idea if the AHA really makes sunburning more likely, or if the SPF lotion is making any difference, but my skin looks and feels great so I'm happy.If you have sensitive skin and haven't used AHA products before you might want to start out with a 8% solution and work your way up, but I haven't had any reaction to this lotion.  If I have a fresh scratch or boo-boo it might sting a little when I first put it on, but that's it.

Even so, CR was quick to point out that NONE of the creams or serums, as they are oft called, made much of a difference.This cream may make your  face tingle a bit--it does on mine, which indicates that it might be slightly acidic and therefore help remove the thinnest layer of skin and with it, some fine lines (whatever that means--they're not so fine to me!).

I started using the Acne.org regimen many years ago, and found that to be sufficient for the most part. Or, at the very least, I thought that my acne was just a fact of life and that The Regimen was the best I could do.About a year ago I bought this stuff and for some reason I never used it but once - maybe because it stung a little. But a month ago I had literally the worst acne flare-up I've had in years: something new every day, deep beneath the skin's surface, and it just wouldn't quit no matter what I did. I went searching online for more ideas, and to my surprise, found this on Acne.org's website with pretty unanimous acclaim (which is impressive since acne ""cures"" seem to be very hit-and-miss). Needless to say, I found my bottle and applied it to the affected areas over night. To my surprise, the very next morning things were looking up: the swollen areas of cystic acne looked somewhat ""deflated"", and places I could feel were about to erupt were no longer feeling that way. Over the next couple of days, the situation went from bad to nearly cured.Since then - about a month - I've had literally had my longest stretch of acne-free living that I can remember in years. I apply it to spots in the morning and leave it on all day, and apply it to my whole face at night. Of course, I always wear sunscreen now and have added a tiny bit of Jojoba oil to that to get totally moisturized and protected skin.I haven't even noticed but one or two little pimples try to pop up, and they literally seem to just fizzle and die after applying this stuff.

I first purchased it at a Longs drug store, because I could see light brown spots coming on one side of my neck, I was in my mid 40's and the little brown area was on the right side of my neck, I do not get in the sun  much so I assumed it came through the car window while I rode in the passenger side.  I knew from research that AHA's that had at least 10% Glycolic acid in them were supposed to even out your skin. I have always had great skin, never before had a dark spot or blemish. So I purchased this and used it after washing my face and appying Witch Hazel, (which I believe is the best thing you can put on your skin). I put a small amount of this AHA lotion all over my face and neck. I could not believe it, after only a few weeks using morning and night  the light brown spots were gone!  Since then I have never been without it, and although I am now  many years from that first bottle. I still have great skin, no spots and the only wrinkle I have is a line between my eyes, most people get two of them I have one!  But I attribute my great skin to good care and good genes but most of all to this Alpha Hydrox lotion.  It sometimes stings a bit after I have exfoliated my skin, but I have never had a bad reaction to it.  I get many compliments on my skin and I do not wear any makeup. I do use Ponds cold cream too. The old tried and true stuff is sometimes better than the newer things on the market. You can't go wrong with this stuff. I only use a two pea sized drops, so it lasts a long time.

Maybe it's age creeping up on me, or it's my endless washing of hands, but about a year ago I noticed I started to acquire those old-man hands with dried/parched skin, especially on the back of them. So I've been trying all kinds of cremes and lotions (go to my reviews page and see; I've reviewed some of what I've tried). A lot of them help, some more, some less, but amazingly, after all this effort, I was in a drugstore on an unrelated errand, and bought -- on impulse -- a jar of this thing here, Cetaphil. I'm not even sure why I did: I've never heard of it before, and I always look for the ingredients to be natural, w/o a chemical factory listed there. Well, to be fair, Cetaphil isn't bad -- no parabens, no fragrances, no colors. But otoh, it's got some chemistry in it though, alcohols and what not. Well, anyway, I got me a jar and tried: wow! It's perfect, better than everything I tried bevor, natural or not natural. It is:1. Bland and neutral (no smell whatsoever).2. Not greasy at all, not even initially.3. Thick but not hard to spread because it's somehow strangely slick, like frozen sour cream I'd imagine would be (except it's not frozen).4. Extremely effective: produces even-textured and even-coloured, supple and hydrated skin in one day; does not clog pores; skin stays hydrated at least a day; survives a handwash or even two somewhat (and then, it's easy to reapply if you need, 'cause unlike a lot of other things I tried, it doesn't smell and therefore can be used at the office w/o bothering anyone around).All my researches and expense, and the 100%-adequate answer was sitting on the shelf in my local drugstore (Walgreens, thirteen-ninety-nine a jar). Who would have known... and it's two to four times cheaper than other thing I tried. I also got the lotion, to compare. I like the creme better (it's more ""substantial"", persistent), but both are good though.Bottom line: Very highly recommended.PS. One thing I'd like to see that's not available is smaller (portable) packages. I can't go around with this bucket on me, it's too big: it's good for home, but I want a small dispenser in my briefcase. There was a small(er), 8 oz, bottle of lotion available there, but no cream in a small container. For now, I'm stuffing a small amount in a tiny tin from Burt's Bees Hand Salve, but it'd be nice if I didn't have to do that.Note 1: it's even cheaper in Wegman's (like ten bucks, +/-).",5.0,Ideal,1319932800,"10 30, 2011"

A37MH7ICH80QOX,B000052YMR,Kate McMurry,"[13, 15]","Dermatologists everywhere, including my own, recommend this cream for patients with eczema. The main thing it has going for it is that it is very thick and it contains no fragrance. I've used this cream for years and have never developed any allergic reactions to it, even though several of its ingredients have the potential to cause allergic reactions in sensitive individuals.I decided tonight, for the first time ever, to analyze every one of the ingredients. It's disappointing to see that it has multiple undesirable ingredients thatCetaphil Lotionlacks. Perhaps the most worrisome ingredient in this skin cream is propylene glycol (see below).Ingredients: Water, petrolatum, glyceryl polymethacrylate, dicaprylyl ether, glycerin, dimethicone, glyceryl stearate, cetyl alcohol, Prunus amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond) oil, PEG-30 glyceryl stearate, tocopheryl acetate, benzyl alcohol, phenoxyethanol, sodium hydroxide, acrylates/C10-30 alkyl acrylate crosspolymer, dimethiconol, disodium EDTA, propylene glycol.Petrolatum: This lab-derived substance has been around since 1859 when chemist Robert Chesebrough developed a method of purifying a black gel that clogged oil rigs called ""rod wax."" On the plus side, petrolatum seems to reduce water loss from the skin better than any other moisturizer currently known. It is also an effective topical barrier for preventing unwanted liquid substances from invading the skin. Premiere examples of the latter use are protecting the skin of babies and incontinent adults from excessive exposure to the ammonia and uric acid (not the same thing as urea) within urine and protecting the skin of serious swimmers from extensive exposure to chlorinated pool water. On the minus side, many consumers prefer not to use a substance derived from petrochemicals on their skin. In addition, as a continual source of moisturizing for the whole body, there is a big downside to petrolatum in that it does not allow the skin to adequately ""breathe."" That is, it prohibits the skin from a normal, necessary function of absorbing moisture from the atmosphere. As a result, petrolatum can actually be less moisturizing over the long run than emollient substances that allow moisture exchange from the air.Glyceryl Polymethacrylate: This substance is used in cosmetics to hydrate the skin by increasing its ability to absorb moisture from the air. It is presumed to help heal and reconstruct the dermis layer of the skin and increase skin firmness because it contains elastin.Dicaprylyl ether: This is an oil derived from a plant, AKA dioctyl ether or Cetiol OE. It functions to condition and smooth the skin. It is a non-greasy emollient that spreads easily and is commonly used in non-irritating or ""sensitive"" skin-care products.Glycerin: Glycerin AKA glycerol and glycerine is commonly found in medical and cosmetic preparations. It is used to provide a smooth sensation and as a humectant. It is safe enough to be consumed internally.Dimethicone: AKA polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS): This is a lab-created polymer derived from silicon, a naturally occurring earth element. It is approved for internal and external use. Allergic reactions usually occur when exposed to this substance in the form of a powder. They include itchy, burning skin, hives, dermatitis, swelling of the mouth and breathing problems. Silicone derivatives act as anti-foaming agents and emollients. They make anything they are in more spreadable. They cause skin and hair to feel silky smooth. They create a protective barrier on the skin that acts as a water repellent, much like petrolatum. They can fill in fine lines on the skin and temporarily smooth out wrinkles.Glyceryl stearate: This ingredient is created in a lab by reacting glycerin with stearic acid (a fatty acid obtained from animal and vegetable fats and oils). It functions as a moisturizer, but it can be a skin irritant for people with sensitive skin.Cetyl alcohol: A fairly natural oil which is produced by hydrogenation of vegetable oils such as palm oil and coconut oil. It is used in cosmetics as an emollient, emulsifier or thickening agent in skin creams and lotions. In rare cases people with eczema find it a skin irritant, but that may be due to impurities in the cetyl alcohol rather than the cetyl alcohol itself.Prunus amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond) oil: Very safe, natural oil.PEG-30 glyceryl stearate: Emulsifying agent. It is a polyethylene glycol ether of glyceryl stearate which is generally considered safe.Tocopheryl acetate: This is a form of vitamin E, a safe preservative. It is generally healing to the skin, but some people can develop an allergy to it, resulting in skin rashes, especially around the eyes. In my own case, I am very allergic to pure vitamin E around my eyes, but I have never experienced any allergic reaction to Cetaphil Cream.Benzyl alcohol: This substance is used as a preservative in IV medication solutions and in cosmetics because of its bacteriostatic and antipruritic properties. It is considered very low risk. It is produced naturally by many plants and commonly found in fruits and teas. It is found in many essential oils, such as jasmine, hyacinth, and ylang-ylang.Phenoxyethanol: When information about the dangers of parabens became widely accepted, quite a few cosmetic companies switched to this preservative which initially seemed safe. Unfortunately, research has begun to reveal that it also may be toxic. Many people develop dermatitis from prolonged exposure to it. It can worsen skin conditions like eczema, and there is growing evidence that it may be a xenoestrogen like the parabens.Sodium hydroxide: Like potassium hydroxide, this is another name for lye. It is used in the paper and chemical industries, for the manufacture of sodium salts and detergents, for pH regulation, and in the production of aluminum. It is used to neutralize acids and increase the alkalinity of whatever it is in. I would presume that is the reason for its use in this product but--lye? Really?Acrylates/C10 30 alkyl acrylate crosspolymer: This is a lab-derived, white powder appearing in just about every topical cosmetic and medication on the market. It is also used in chewable and sublingual tablets. Though considered safe enough to consume internally, like Vitamin E, some people develop an allergic reaction with long-term use leading to rashes and swelling (dermatitis). So far, I've never personally developed an allergy to Cetaphil so, presumably, I'm not allergic to this ingredient.Dimethiconol: Similar to dimethicone (see above).Disodium EDTA: This compound is widely used in processed foods and beverages, cosmetics, contact solution and eye drops as a preservative and stabilizer in many processed foods and beverages. When combined with vitamin C and sodium bicarbonate (baking soda), it forms benzene, a dangerous carcinogen. This chemical reaction is most obvious when this compound is taken internally.Propylene glycol: This lab-derived compound is a form of mineral oil commonly used in brake and hydraulic fluid and in antifreeze. Cosmetic products employ it as a humescent, to prevent the escape of moisture from the skin. Unfortunately, the Material Safety Data Sheet of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) states that it is a strong skin irritant which can dry the skin. In addition, due to being absorbed into the blood stream through the skin, it can potentially cause kidney damage and liver abnormalities.",4.0,Widely recommended for soothing irritated skin,1359072000,"01 25, 2013"

It eliminates dry skin within a few hours. My friend who has to wash your hands eight times a day or so was struggling so much due this winter. Both of her children also have hands that look so chapped you would think that they were sunburned. I bought this to give her a sample of as well. She keeps it right on the counter, and is one of the best testimonials of how well this product works. Besides its effectiveness, the odorless, nongreasy, tasteless, very thick and potent moisturizer to me is the gold standard for any topical cream that I have ever come across. I use it on scratches that I get very easily during the winter, I use it after shaving, even to calm down the sunburn over aloe & vera.

The oil is quickly absorbed into the skin, almost nothing is left on the towel used to dry yourself. Once dry, your skin is silky smooth but not oily. The fragrance is delicate and clean and not cloying.I then apply a good moisturizer like(Olay Quench Body Lotion Extra Dry Skin - 20.2 Oz)to my hands, feet, elbows and any other area that I think could use a little more softening and smoothing.The oil and the moisturizer combine to form a moisture barrier on the skin that lasts and lasts.

I used to use Clinique Dramatically Different Moisturizing Gel, but decided to try something less expensive. The Clinique moisturizer has a more runny consistency than this moisturizer and glided on the skin more easily. This moisturizer is a little bit thicker and that makes it more moisturizing than the Clinique. I felt like the Clinique moisturizer just stayed on the skin for a few hours and than my cheeks started to feel dry and I'd feel like I needed to reapply it again. I don't have to to reapply with this one. My skin still feels moisturized hours later. This moisturizer has a lightweight feel and that's key for me because I have oily skin. I just use a very small amount and that's enough to cover my whole face and neck. It doesn't make my skin feel greasy at all. I haven't noticed any breakouts with this moisturizer either. I have an oily T-zone and my cheeks are usually dry and tend to get a little flaky. The Clinique moisturizer didn't do anything for the flakiness on my cheeks. This moisturizer absorbs into the skin perfectly and I no longer have flakiness on my cheeks. One day I washed my face and decided not to use this moisturizer to see how my face would feel. I immediately noticed the difference. This moisturizer fits my budget and my skin loves it. It's something I'll definitely repurchase.",5.0,Better than Clinique,1361059200,"02 17, 2013"

It is an extremely thick cream, and you really only need to use a tiny dab.  The cream is quite emollient, and I believe that most people will see dryness relief from use of this product.

The second concern is somewhat related--I absolute HATE the screw cap!

I nearly tossed it when I was moving but decided to keep it, and I'm so glad I did. I use Epiduo for my acne, which dried out my combo/dry skin even more and made it very red and sensitive. My entire face, and especially around my eyes, was so painfully dry and flaky. Even fragrance-free/sensitive skin creams and lotions still burned and irritated my skin. My skin was flaking so bad during the day from my makeup it was disgusting by the end of the day. I thought I was just going to have to stop using my acne creams altogether, my face was so bad.One night in desperation I pulled this out of the medicine cabinet, and noticed on the back it was non-comodegenic and said you could use it anywhere- lips, eyes, face. I bravely slathered this everywhere, and it was like a miracle for my skin. It didn't burn, there was no fragrance, and it soothed my irritated skin. After a few days of using it morning and night my skin was 200% improved, and my acne has almost entirely cleared up.

It's not really a cream, which initially disappointed me; it's basically a slightly thinner, petrolatum/vaseline-type product. I initially just wanted a fragrance-free creamy hand lotion I could put rub into my hands the same way I would with any other lotion. But this has a slightly different purpose; it's more of a dry skin treatment than a standard lotion-type moisturizer. I found that if I rubbed just a dab on the backs of my hands and on my nails where they can get a rough, ragged and chapped, it softened them up within a matter of a few days. And because it's a little thinner than vaseline, it rubs right in. If it leaves behind any residue, I haven't noticed. I also use it on other dry areas like my elbows and knees without concern that it will come off on my clothes. I have also started using it 2 or 3 times a day on the very rough, dry areas on my feet, including my heels. I spend much of the year barefoot and never wear socks down here in our almost tropical climate. Now, with just a few applications, most of the dry areas are basically ""cured,"" and my VERY dry, cracked heels are close to it. I will have to continue using it as a preventive measure, but it does work beautifully.Since the tube size is legally small enough to put in my carry-on on flights and I prefer the fragrance-free version, I can also use it on my face around my eyes and my lips which get dry on long flights. It's basically a multi-purpose product I wouldn't be without and costs no more than a regular jar of vaseline.

However, I notice that my cuticles are very well moisturized when I use this and the effects last several hours. I suggest using it sparingly. It won't be my holy grail hand cream, but I will definitely use it in conjunction with a more fast absorbing and lighter lotion.",4.0,"Thick, but moisturizing",1381795200,"10 15, 2013"

I have been using Crabtree & Evelyn's gardner's hand therapy for years and have really liked it, but this stuff just plain works better. The other stuff is good though, if you need an alternative, but it's more expensive and frankly isn't as good.I live in the Pacific Northwest, which typically doesn't have a very dry climate. But we are having a very cold spell right now with no moisture in the air and my skin is drying up something awful. And, this stuff has saved my hands and, believe it or not, my face! I use argan & maracuja oils on my face typically and they do wonders, but this magic potion is taking care of a pesky dry spot on my face as we speak.This stuff is fragrance free too, so any of you sensitive folks will have no problem.

A1LX95ESZ0HDYL,B000052YP6,"M. Hudson ""FaithFunFamily""","[1, 1]","**Updated review--I've continued to use this product daily and found that it also works on razor burn. I found the product to be incredibly soothing on any surface used to shave (legs, face, etc), and of course the product absorbs immediately. With highly sensitive skin that is prone to break out for any reason under the sun, this product continues to get an A+ from me and from those in my family that use the product as well.**This item was pricey, but well worth every penny. First of all, this product is extremely thick so a little goes a very, very long way.This is an intensive lotion meant to treat dry skin and restore it to it's naturally soft condition. I found that it is best used at nighttime. I've tried using it with nighttime gloves, and that works well too. I just prefer to rub it on my hands and go to bed. The only reason that I didn't give it 5 stars is because I don't prefer to wear gloves at night, and because it takes time to absorb, you pretty much need the gloves so you don't chance getting the lotion on other things while it dries. I figured it out to be about 20 minutes before it fully absorbed, but I put on quite a bit!Because this takes longer to absorb, I wouldn't recommend using this as a daily lotion you might leave by the soap dish by the bathroom next to the sink.I use this daily, and because it's so concentrated, that's all I need to maintain smoother skin. It's no easy task when you have kids of your own and are around kids at a daycare where germs spread like the plague. For every diaper change, sneeze, runny nose and shared food, I am washing my hands A LOT! This product works as advertised!It also works wonders on cracked elbows, heels and is soothing for skin conditions like Eczema.",5.0,"rich, absorbs quickly, good on sensitive skin and effective!",1362787200,"03 9, 2013"
A19KOAGQJUXL18,B000052YP6,Miss Betsy,"[0, 0]","This hand cream was created for use by Norwegian fishermen working in the North Atlantic.  There is nothing glamorous about it. It doesn't have pretty packaging, there is no pretty fragrance, it tends to be a little slow to absorb and it is gooey if you get  too much on.  However...it is hands down, without a doubt, the hand cream that produces the best results over any other, in my opinion.  I use it at night (I use a more easily absorbed cream during the day) and the next morning my hands are kitten-soft and incredibly smooth.  Not surprising.  After all, if it can help those fishermen braving the icey waters of the North Atlantic, think what it can do with our hands!",5.0,The best hand cream ever...,1391472000,"02 4, 2014"

My hands were horribly red and between my fingers were starting to bleed.  It got to the point if water even touched my hands, it really hurt.  I bought this after seeing some adverts for it.  I am so happy I did.  The first time I used it, it was a little off putting because it is so thick.  I didn't know why it wasn't absorbing into my hands.  Then I realized I just had to work it into my hands more than normal lotion.  After the first use, I noticed a difference.  After daily use for months, my hands feel great and are still soft.I only use this right before I go to bed.  I work it into my hands, wait a couple minutes, then work a little more in.  Some people may find this overkill but like I said, my hands get very dry.  Because it's so thick, I don't use this during the day.  I uses Aveeno Daily Moisturizing Lotion a few times throughout the day.  But, if I didn't use this at night, the Aveeno wouldn't be so effective during the day.",5.0,"Saved my dry, cracked, bleeding hands",1392422400,"02 15, 2014"

The Neutrogena lotion showed up at exactly the right time! I was even more surprised to see how fast it worked. The thick and greasy formula is obviously for when your skin needs emergency attention, and it took no more than two days for my skin to look and feel better. You'd have no idea my skin was dry and flaky just last week!The Norwegian formula, as I mentioned, it quite thick. It looks like a translucent gel in the bottle. It stays exactly where you put it and turns white as you rub it into your skin. You definitely need to rub it in well, and a little goes a long way. If you use too much, your skin might feel a little sticky after.I wouldn't recommend it for every day use if you're not experiencing rather dry skin, but it's great for cracked and dry hands and feet, too!I'd definitely buy this again if the dry skin returns.",4.0,Emergency Skin Care,1357516800,"01 7, 2013"
A3AGU9IY4LDG03,B000052YP6,P. Berry,"[14, 14]","This is hands down THE best product for dry hands! As it says on the front of the tube, ""just a dab"" rubbed into the back of each hand and, poof, scales, cracks, dryness, and pain are GONE. The effects last for several washings. It's amazing. One tube lasts a long time because you use only a dab at a time. Don't over-apply! Suggestion: draw a short, thin line of product across the back of one hand and use one finger of the other hand to massage it in from wrist to fingertips; after the gel turns white and then disappears into your skin, repeat on the opposite hand; then rub your hands together to get any remaining gel onto the inside of your hands. Apply sparingly. Don't use it like ordinary hand lotions/creams - it's not like those products; it's a one-of-a-kind product. Applied correctly, it will leave your hands smooth and soft without feeling wet or greasy. It's fragrance-free, so there's no obnoxious perfume smell.
