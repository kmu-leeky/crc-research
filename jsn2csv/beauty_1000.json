Hairstyle - long enough to run a comb through, usually let it grow for 1.5 months then cut back.The Biotin B-Complex conditioner is a daily counterbalance to the Biotin Shampoo. The Shampoo is harsh but effective. It leaves my hair feeling like a brillo pad and the conditioner helps break that apart. When used together the signs of balding are significantly reduced (seeing your scalp through the hair). Also, my hairstyle is a lot easier and fuller looking (messy and pushed up in the front).Even with the combination I found my hair needing a break from the two. I use Organix Coconut milk conditioner once a week to soften my hair. This is an extremely effective break.The proportions I use suit my taste. The appearance of thickness is all I really care about.

I've only been using it for a week, so I do not expect to see hair growth at this point.  It's good to note that I'm 42 years old, w/disturbing hair loss.The bottles are SMALL so I'm not using it carelessly. The smell is not flowery & fun, but it's more medicinal in scent, not overpowering. The shampoo lathers if you work at it, & it's a low lather rather than a high and luffy one. I rub it gently on my scalp & throughout my hair. If scrub too hard, I'll lose MORE HAIR. :( I am washing my hair every day, where I used to wash every other day. The conditioner does not lather.  It's more of a cream that I rub gently onto wet hair. My hair feels sort of weighty as I wash it & I think that I'm going to have a BAD HAIR DAY ahead of me, but after styling, it's actually soft, manageable, not weighty! After washing, I wrap in a towel for about 5 minutes, apply FINESSE styling mousse, let my brown curls air dry. Sometimes a touch of hairspray but most days, not. With the thick feel in the shower, I am surprised that it's not weighted down after styling. SO, I'll keep on trying this for 3 months. I'll try to remember to update if I see a difference. Feel free to ask me questions.**IT'S IMPORTANT TO MENTION THAT ALONG W/THE SHAMPOO & CONDITIONER, I'M TAKING, MAXI HAIR SUPPLEMENTS.  My Dr. was pleased w/the ingredients of the shamp, cond AND supplements. I use the supplements in place of a multi so I also take OMEGA 3 & Calcium Citrate w/ D3. (As per Dr).**6/27/2013 - Although there is NO new hair growth, I've noticed that I'M LOSING LESS HAIR when I wash & style!  It's enough for me to notice & enough for me to keep going w/ this trial. 19 days in, w/ consistent use of shamp/cond & Maxi Hair, my hair is smoother, softer, shinier stronger, doesn't have a bad smell, still not weighty & continues to be manageable. I feel like whatever residue was clogging my hair is out. My hope is that this is the case for my scalp & maybe, just maybe, I'll see some new sprouts. A girl can dream. :)6/30/2013 - Could it be?  New hair?  Will keep you posted.  I see three short hairs poking through!  I should also note that my nails need to be trimmed more often than ever, and I have to shave, (legs, underarms), more frequently!  I suspect this would be from the internal good I'm getting from the Maxi-Hair supplement.7/21/2013 - YES!  Still losing less hair, AND there IS new hair growth in little stray spots.  My nails, which I keep short, need to be cut once every week to 10 days as opposed to once every 3 or more weeks!  I rcvd two complements on my hair this past week, about how shiny &healthy; it looks!  I remain faithful to the products, using them EVERY DAY as recommended.9/21/13 - IMPORTANT UPDATE.  It seems that with months of use, this product is GREAT for clearing up any residue on my scalp, BUT it is drying out my hair.  I have to rotate my use of this and the conditioner.  It's stripping the oils from my hair.  I will still use the shampoo and conditioner, but may just use it once a week.  WIll keep updating.  I did notice that for the past two weeks, when I use the products, my scalp gets just a little itchy.  That also indicates to me that the residue blocking my pores may be cleared up!  That is the good part!  SO, I will be using the MAXI HAIR daily as bottle recommends, but will limit the use of the shampoo and conditioner.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Losing less hair!

I had such high hopes, but in only two shampooings, my hair was noticeably stripped of oils, had that &#34;squeaky clean&#34; feeling you get when using a very harsh product, and it became dry and brittle. It started looking very dull. They use many products that have an oil stripping effect on the hair, like orange oil and lemon oil. You might think because it says, 'oil' that it might add to your hair's shine, but these are ingredients in industrial strength degreasers. This product only damaged my hair. Avalon is only 70% organic and it had a rather unpleasant smell to me. Rather like mosquito repellant or dish soap. Using a harsh product like this is very detrimental for your hair. I know that a lot of people will be drawn to Avalon because of the low price, but if it drastically stripped my extremely oily hair in two shampoos, I can't imagine what it might do to yours. Although my hair is very fine, so perhaps ethnic girls, and women with coarser hair might benefit? I honestly wouldn't recommend it. I'd rather see people get something that will improve their self-esteem immediately, rather than give them new problems to worry about.In desperation I purchased the more expensive Just Naturals system for thinning hair and believe me, it blows Avalon out of the water. In just one shampoo my hair regained it's texture and became so silky it felt like Asian hair. I can't stop touching my hair now and I feel so much more confident. They use incredible ingredients that greatly benefit people with hair loss due to hormonal issues, or who have an increase in DHT. You do pay more than double for that shampoo, but having something that supports your hair, improves the texture, and smells fantastic, was worth it to me. I'm now quite confident in what I'm using and plan to go on using it, regardless of the cost. I'd pay 5x what I'm paying for it now, I love it so much. And their treatment spray is oil based. I use the system twice a day and I'm shocked at how long it is lasting. It has truly been an excellent investment.I would recommend that you shampoo and condition your hair twice a day if you want to see regrowth with any system. This is because one application of shampoo with DHT-fighting ingredients, can only do so much. Your body is constantly generating new hormones and new DHT. By helping to combat it twice a day, you have a better chance of seeing results sooner. This is coming from a 36 year old woman who has been fighting repeated hair loss due to hormonal imbalance from 16 on. Once a day just never cut it for me. Using a leave on treatment like Just Naturals has overnight, can also work wonders. I use it during the day too if I'm not going out.I hope this helps you recover your hair, and your self-esteem, a little faster and more efficiently. :o)", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Industrial strength degreaser. \"Fullness\" is caused by stripping oils and making hair fluffy", "unixReviewTime": 1401840000, "reviewTime": "06 4, 2014"}

I wanted to get rid of all the bottles and tubes in my tub as they were forever landing by my feet causing a risk for me to fall. This unit is superb. It was easy to install if you follow the clear instructions. Once up it takes 24 hours for the glue to cure and then you can fill the pumps. The bottles are quite large so you do not have to refill to often. Included in the package are labels so you can choose which pump goes for shampoo or shower gel or soap. I do not use conditioner so I used 3 pumps for shower gels and 1 for my shampoo. The products flow freely once you prime the pumps and so far there has not been a problem in pumping out generous amounts of gel and shampoo. It looks neat and clean in the tub and shower.

I have a variety of liquids in it, and two are actually very thick. I had no problem priming the thing and getting it going, so even the thick stuff pumps out smoothly, without any issues. As far as mounting goes, the silicon they provided was hardened and fairly useless, only got a little bit out. Luckily, I had a tube of rubber adhesive (similar to the silicon, but a bit thinner), which worked fine to attach the plastic base of the unit to the uneven ceramic tile of my shower wall. It is on there solid, and not going anywhere. I have used the silicon type adhesive with another product (aDeluxe LED Fogless Shower Mirror with Squeegee by ToiletTree Products. Guaranteed Not to Fog, Designed Not to Fall. 20% Larger Than Our #1 Selling Original Mirror.I ordered here on amazon) and it works equally well. Of course they have not been time-tested, but this method is a heck of a lot better then suction cups. In terms of getting the things off when/if the time comes, I can't help ya there, but others in these reviews have mentioned product that can clean off the adhesive residue from tile. If I have to take these down at some point, it will probably be just to replace them. I am not renting, so I don't have to worry about that.I was pleasantly surprised to find the claims about saving soap/shampoo to be very true. I use a lot less with this dispenser then when squirting directly from the bottle. A few pumps get you going, then an occasional pump to keep the lather going. It's much easier to control, because less comes out with each pump of the dispenser, but I want to emphasize, it is in NO WAY inconvenient or difficult to get enough soap out with quickly with a few pumps-- faster then messing with the bottles themselves or with bar soap for that matter.I got the white plastic, which I am sure will discolor over time, as does almost all white plastic-- but that is just a guess, and I don't really care.I give it 4 our of 5 because of the silicon issue (and if I didn't have any lying around the house, and had to order some more and wait on it, I might have been irritated enough to bump another star-- but that would be unfortunate, because it really is a great product, even if you need to order your own adhesive).Conclusion: highly recommend, no reservations!", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Works great.", "unixReviewTime": 1321142400, "reviewTime": "11 13, 2011"}

The tip does not get very hot at all.Heating is very quick, about a minute, and it has a simple rotary knob built into the handle to adjust the heat.  The controls are near where some people may hold the barrel, so you could accidentally touch them, but I think the barrel design makes it simple enough to avoid that (the rotary switch is on a thicker barrel part, adjacent to the heating iron.  The switch has 25 power levels, as well as an On/Off switch and indicator, and a &#34;Turbo Heat&#34; button and indicator.There is a small metal rest at the bottom of the barrel to help keep the hot barrel off surfaces when you place it down.The 5' cord is designed to swivel to minimize tangles.Conair backs the curling iron with a 2 year warranty.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Inexpensive Yet Functional", "unixReviewTime": 1395705600, "reviewTime": "03 25, 2014"}

There are several good things about this product but a couple of negatives that bring my rating down a notch.Pros:*Long lasting.  It stays on all day, from morning until night*No flaking, peeling, fading, or smudging.  It stays exactly how you applied it and doesn't give you racoon eyes.*The color is so rich, black, and dark.  The color really makes my eyes pop and gives them that extra oomph.*It dries quickly and doesn't feel wet on your eye lids.*It's affordable and you seem to get a lot of product for the price.Cons:*It is somewhat difficult to remove at night.  I use makeup remover and I have to rub at it a little more than I do with other eyeliners to remove it completely.*It is a little difficult to apply in the sense that not a lot of product gets onto the brush to transfer to your lids.  I have to screw the cap on, shake it, and then remove the brush about 3-4 times to get the look I'm going for.  I don't know if I just got an old produt or if the formula is drier because it's waterproof (I think that's the reason), but it's not a huge deal unless you only have a little bit of time to apply this liner.Overall, this is a good liner that gives a dark, dramatic color and stays on all day without flaking or smudging.  I found it to be a little difficult to apply and remove at night and had to spend a little bit more effort doing this than I've had to do with other liners.

I didn't need a makeup remover wipe to take it off, I could practically peel it off. Weird!! Was it my eye? Was it the liner? I determined eventually that 95% of it was caused by the fact that the bottle of liner I was using was OLD. Like, several years old. I knew it was old from the start, but it was an otherwise great liner, so I continued to use it. It wasn't until I bought a new bottle recently that I figured this out. The new stuff will still crack occasionally in small amounts if I wear it for a long time and I guess scrunch my eyes up a lot, but nowhere near the amount it used to.The brush is advertised as tapered but it's not as tapered as I would have expected.

It worked for me but there were no 'instant' improvements. In my case the itchiness went away VERY slowly but, 3 months later, it's 99% gone.I'm not sure what the exact problem my scalp had but it was itchy like... you know what. It began about one year ago and I couldn't stop myself from scratching which, of course, ensured that my scalp stayed itchy and irritated. Discussing the problem with our good family doctor back in October or November (7-8 months ago) did not help much. He had nothing to prescribe but suggested that I massage my scalp with cortisone cream - messy because I have a fully head of hair and I am not planning to shave it - and predicting that the itchiness will get worse in the winter. (Thank you doc!)To make the story short, a couple of months ago I stumbled upon a bottle of T/Gel left over from the time I used it (effectively) to address a dandruff problem and decided to give it a try. The box claims that this is 'effective from the first use'. It's not. My scalp was still itchy one month later but maybe not as much. And... a couple of weeks ago I just noticed - I wasn't scratching or massaging my head any more. The itch was largely gone.I can't say that the T/Gel cured me and it's quite possible that the itchiness would come back if I stopped using it. Maybe I will experiment with that in a couple of months but, at this time, I am content and happy to have it at least under control with one weekly T/Gel use. Yes, it smells a little funny but if you use it before going to bed the smell should be gone by morning.The product deserves my 5 stars because it worked for me. It's possible that it doesn't work for everyone but I can't see how trying it would hurt.____________________________________NOTE: about the smell.The active ingredient that addresses itching and flaking is 'coal tar' which is smelly.

When I was younger, my head would itch so bad, I would sometimes scratch to the point my scalp would bleed. As I got older, I learned to only wear light colored tops and buy light colored coats and jackets so that my flakes wouldn't be so overt.One day I went to the doctor for a sinus infection and while I was there I asked him what he recommended for my dandruff - thinking he would write a prescription for radioactive kryptonite or something expensive that would turn my hair green.  The doctor said, \"Neutrogena T-Gel.\" I asked, \"Is that a prescription?\" \"No,\" he replied. I was stunned. I had used Head and Shoulders, Selson Blue and just about everything else on the market - how would this be different? The doctor was persistent and emphasized that T-Gel should work, so I gave it a shot.This stuff has been a life-saver. It's not very glamorous looking - brown, weird smelling shampoo - but just a dollup the size of a nickel is all I need to lather up my entire head - and I have very thick, curly hair.  The longer you let it sit on your scalp, the better - 3 minutes is ideal. Despite the unusual smell from the bottle, your hair just smells fresh and clean.Unlike other shampoos, I have never had to take a \"vacation\" and use another shampoo to \"liven up\" my hair. T-Gel is pretty basic stuff - no perfumes or weird chemicals - the active ingredient, Coal Tar, is a byproduct from the coal processing industry and this gives it its dark color.  I have used T-Gel for almost 15 years now and I never have flakes and I probably scratch my head 3 times a year. About 30% of my hair is now white and silver and I have not had a problem with the shampoo discoloring it.Once in a while I will get free shampoo samples in the mail and use other shampoos, but just after 2 hair washings w/o T-Gel, my scalp will start itching again.  It seems expensive when you see the price, but one bottle usually lasts me for 3-4 months since you only need a little dab.When I used to color my hair, I used a conditioner for colored hair and it didn't seem to cancel out the effects of T-Gel... and after my hair is dry, I use yet another brand of mousse and a hair serum to style my hair - and still, no itching.If you have dandruff and haven't tried T-Gel, just give it a try - in one week, you should be symptom free!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "works wonders!", "unixReviewTime": 1071619200, "reviewTime": "12 17, 2003"}

This made sense to me, though, as my scalp could get flaky and a little itchy at times. She recommended T/Sal. I figured, oh, great....I have to use a medicated shampoo now. I bet it will smell weird and dry out my hair.Well, not only does it smell like nothing, it works really well on my flaky/itchy issue, and to my shock and joy, it is not only gentle on my hair, but makes it super shiny and full. I would go as far as to say it is my favorite shampoo, period. Not my favorite medicated shampoo, just a great all 'round shampoo for everyone.I also use my wonderful Br&ouml;&ouml; beer shampoo, but I have found that the T/Sal even makes that work better too. I shampoo first with the T/Sal, then once with the Br&ouml;&ouml;. They are both free of harsh sulfates and the T/Sal is surprisingly simple in its ingredients. I believe the salicylic acid must be cutting any residue on my hair and so, making it behave better. T/Sal seems to make all my other shampoos and conditioners work better. I used to use Neutrogena's build up removing shampoo, but found it too harsh (sulfates) and too pungent. The T/Sal is far superior.This is a great shampoo if you have a &#34;reason&#34; to use it, and even if you don't .

I've tried all baby shampoos on the market (Johnson and Johnson, Aveeno, California Baby, Mustela) and none helped.A few months ago I discovered thatDove Bar Soap, Sensitive Skin Unscented, 4 Ounce, 16 Counthad been the main cause of redness and intense itching on her skin, which doctors thought was atypical eczema. After discontinuing Dove her skin has mostly cleared up and she no longer itches.I wondered if the detergent (surfuctant) base in most baby shampoos could be triggering a similar response. I knew dandruff shampoos were sometimes recommended for cradle cap in babies, so I tried a small amount (quarter size) ofNeutrogena T/Sal Shampoo, Scalp Build-up Control, 4.5 fl ozon her, left it on for five minutes, rinsed well and reapplied, leaving it on for another five minutes. I thought her curly hair would be a dry frizzy mess but was surprised when it dried and it was very soft and wavy; a dime size dab ofAveeno Baby Eczema Therapy Moisturizing Cream, 5 Ounceworked through her hair and scalp, a spray of water and some scrunching is all that's needed to form ringlets that hold all day. Her scalp cleared up in less than a week, and although she isn't cured - it comes back if I don't use it on her -  I'm glad to finally have found a solution.I use T-Sal once or twice a week on her, if any scales reappear - otherwise, I useBella B Bee Gone Cradle Cap Baby Shampoo 8 Oz. This shampoo is aloe based, hypoallergenic and paraben free, with a light fragrance that hasn't caused any issues. Both shampoos have worked well on my other children who sometimes get cradle cap as well.On my end, I am sensitive to fragrances and my hair reacts terribly to strong sulfuctants and silicones found in \"hydrating\" shampoos, causing a huge amount of frizz, dryness, build up and breakage. Before trying T-Sal on my children, I tried it on my wavy hair. I was also surprised to see how well T-Sal cleaned and how soft and light feeling my hair dried afterwards. I've also noticed it helps my hand eczema (from using strong detergents such asDial 1423982 Purex Ultra Free and Clear Concentrated Liquid Detergent, 100oz Bottle, (Pack of 4)), if I leave the shampoo on my hands as long as I do on my hair.I now use T-Sal to help remove product build up and alternate withDHS Clear Shampoo 16 ozandDHS Conditioning Rinse with Panthenol, Fragrance Free 8 fl oz (236 ml), both very mild no-frills products that work really well.The only thing I don't like is the small size.

I gradually lost 56 pounds and lowered my blood sugar levels, and my cholesterol levels dramatically.Since that time I went off of it, returned to my bad ways of eating, regained the weight, and blood sugar and cholesterol went way up again.For the past several months I have once again been taking fiber supplements. I had been taking Konjac Glucommanan Powder and have been very pleased with it. But, I decided to try Konsyl again since I can just go to the store and buy it instead of ordering online.I do not like taking the Konsyl as well as I like the Konjac Glucomannan. And, there is some differences in the two fibers. Konjac Glucomannan is solely a soluable fiber (which will more effectively lower your cholesterol), while Konsyl is a mixture of both soluable fiber and non-soluable fiber (the non-soluable fiber helps 'sweet' your colon and creates faster transit, while the soluable fiber lowers the cholesterol but doesn't increase the speed of transit).So, if your transit time is too fast you may want to look more at taking Konjac Glucomannan. But, if your transit time is too slow Konsyl would be better. If you want (more) lowering of cholesterol than Konjac Glucomannan would be the way to go. If you want faster transit along with cholesterol lowering than Konsyl is the way to go.I have decided to alternate using both products; one product at one meal, the other product at the other meal. So, alternating both products should give me the best of both.Konjac Glucomannan sticks to the side of the glass if you don't mix and drink fast enough, but it goes down smoothe. But, there also is a slightly odd flavor to Konjac Glucomannan. Konsyl is a pretty much flavorless fiber, but has gritty path down that I really don't care for.

The sponge is definitely a strong scrub on one side, good for elbows, legs and maybe your hard to reach places on your back.

I have tried every. single. lotion/acne-clearer possibly available on the market from the time I was 13 (I am now 22). To make that search all the more difficult, I am incredibly SENSITIVE skin... the kind where I have to be careful to wash my bedsheets with odor-free detergent. Sometimes when putting on shirts (that I wash with a nicely scented detergent) if it touches the side of my face it begins to itch and then I have an allergic reaction in that very spot. I am *that* sensitive. Hence, most of the \"Guaranteed\" products out there made me face swell up like a red water-balloon literally (Proactiv).I don't know the technical term, but I suffer from a vicissitude of extremely dry & extremely oily skin. My chin and lower half of my cheeks and around my mouth get extremely dry, peel, itch, and then if I itch form red spots, etc. I stress all this as I find it EXTREMELY important when giving this product the review I'm going to give it.To not digress further, I went to my dermatologist and decided not to use Acutane due to the risks, and was put on Monodox \"as needed\". When I'm breaking out badly, I take one for 2-3 days consecutively and then stop for about a week and repeat the process. So, this is my explanation to explain my acne condition.As far as MOISTURIZER, I've been so desperate to find the right moisturizer that would help give me that 'soothing' feeling versus itching, stinging, or masking my face with oil. If it stung, it would end up itching after a while, and hence make my condition worse, not better. If it simply felt like a 'masked' feeling in the face, then it simply did absolutely nothing for me and didn't help the dryness at all.This is the ONE and ONLY topical product I have ever used that's helped me. Not only have I found the absolute perfect moisterizer, but for my personal skin condition, it truly does all it states. I *LOVE* the tingly clean feeling! It's like having mint on your face and walking outside on a cool, crisp morning. It has 0 oil. None. I leave it on for hours and it's perfect. The best thing is that it somehow doesn't irritate my capricious face. I was fed up with my face and bought this on a whim.

I did a lot of research and found this to be the best B.P. product on the market. It is 2.5% B.P and this is the amount you need in a product, if you go over that it is much too harsh for your skin (especially mine because it is sensitive). Obviously if you have severe acne and need medication type products, that might be different for you. But for the average face, anything over 2.5% B.P is much too harsh. I actually don't buy this product on Amazon I just buy it at my local WalMart and it is about the same price on Amazon, minus the shipping charge. I'd say it's a pricey little product for the small tube you are getting, especially the way I use it all over my face but, hey it works and that's why I stick to it. The other two products I use last months and aren't that expensive for how long they last so I can afford to use this product. While it says it is an \"On the spot\" treatment, I actually use it all over my face. Because it is not a gel and it is creamy, you can't really apply it all over your face then rub it in, you'll have to apply a small amount to your finger and apply in batches. I don't find this annoying or hard to do, though some might because it takes a bit longer. When I first started using this product I only applied a small amount to my face in certain spots to get my skin used to it. Progressively over 2 weeks I began to use more and more and my skins takes it like a champ now. Even though it is a B.P. product, I actually don't get the stiff feeling after applying it all over my face. It also does not leave a white residue as other creamy products might do, it is a little difficult to work in if you're using small amounts but it goes on well. I find that it clears my skin up well but of course I get an occasional pimple or so due to that time of the month or stress or whatever, but much less than I used to!

Jones \"movie buff\"", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "After reading that alternating cleansers was better for your skin than using the same one every day, I decided to try this one for every-other-day use. How I use it: Put about a nickle sized dollop on my fingertips and rub it into my face, then gently rinse by wiping off with a warm soft washcloth. I often put my face under the shower faucet for a brief 2-3 second rinse after that, too, which I know many skincare professionals discourage, but I find I get a better rinse that way, especially in the area where my face meets my hair.Basis is a thinnish gel consistency which feels great to the touch, and has a wonderful scent. It cleans well, though I found it wasn't very good at taking off makeup. For days when I don't wear makeup, it's just fine, but when trying to take off the usual foundation and powder, some was always left behind and I had to grab a second cleanser. For the usual oil, dust, etc., though, it's good.There's a slick feeling to the skin after you use it, which doesn't come off no matter how much you rinse. I wasn't fond of that at first but have come to get used to it. That alone was enough to make me decide not to buy a second bottle.But the biggest problem was for the more delicate skin under and around my eyes. I'm 42 so my under-eye skin has definitely had changes since I was younger, and it's much less able to take a strong cleanser. Basis left red patches in the under-eye area near the nose, and though moisturizer helped, there were dry flakes left behind. Even if it looked okay at a glance, when I put makeup on it was very noticeable. I avoid that area now and it's all good -- my forehead, chin and nose were the oiliest parts anyway -- but unless your entire face is oily, this may not be the cleanser for you.I'm a little disappointed because the price, the consistency and the scent are perfect, but there are just too many cons for me to buy a second time.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "terrific scent, consistency and cleaning, too harsh on skin", "unixReviewTime": 1397865600, "reviewTime": "04 19, 2014"}

So when I spotted this bar of cleanser that stated it was antibacterial (without benzoyl peroxide which on the bad side will cause early signs of aging on your skin - Bleh!!!) I have tested and tried it, even sometimes alternating with Cetaphil facial cleanser and what a difference! My skin this past week has never been in such better shape nor clearer!

I'm fortunate not to have sensitive or allergic skin reactions to fragrance ingredients, but I still have to avoid most of them because for me, strong perfumes set off major migraines. Other than that, some of the scents in skincare products are actually quite nice. But this...

I'm a Florida native with blonde hair and fair skin, so after a lifetime of sun my face had issues with some sunspots and a blotchy complexion.  I don't have problems with breakouts and only have a few faint \"laugh line\" wrinkles that I'm not worried about yet so this review won't address those issues.Since I can't afford constant facials I did some research and developed my own skin-care regimen.  Exfoliating dead skin cells is important so I decided an AHA product would be useful and ordered this creme and began using it most nights after washing my face.  I leave it on anywhere from 10 minutes to an hour and then use an eye cream and moisturizing lotion.  I had some very mild tingling the first time I used it but nothing after that - if you have sensitive skin you might want to try the 8% version first and work your way up to the 10%.After doing this for about 6 weeks I can see a definite difference in my skin that can't be attributed to just the moisturizing.  The sunspots are still there (and always will be) but they are much, much lighter and less noticeable.  The blotchiness has evened out considerably and I feel like I could run up to the store without makeup and not worry about frightening small children.  [...smile...]  As I said, I don't have much in the way of wrinkles so I really haven't noticed whether this has done anything to clear them up or not.  I doubt any skin product will do anything for serious wrinkles anyway, and if that's your worry you'll need to look into some kind of doctor or aesthetician's services.I highly recommend this product for anybody who wants to get serious about taking care of their skin.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "I Love This Creme!!!", "unixReviewTime": 1217894400, "reviewTime": "08 5, 2008"}

They used to sell the 12% Alpha Hydrox cream at Walgreen's but they don't carry it anymore. I learned years ago when I first started using it that the best concentration for an alpha hydroxy acid (AHA) is between 8% to 12% and the ideal pH is 3 to 4. You can use a pH test strip to check the pH. The Alpha Hydrox cream has a concentration of 10 and a pH of 4. The souffle works well too but the cream is cheaper and works exactly the same. I've tried other alpha hydroxy acids in the past with a higher concentration of AHA but the pH was too high to make it effective. The higher the pH, the greater the buffer and that reduces the strength of the AHA and renders it useless. I've been using this brand for years although I've occasionally tried others.

For night use if my skin feels dry, I sometimes apply some Alpha Hydrox nourishing night creme (it doesn't contain AHAs).I'm not sure if this does much for lines and wrinkles- first, I don't have many, and I haven't used this long enough, but this creme does a wonderful job for dry skin with patches, and for uneven skin, through faster renewal, and dead skin cell removal.I definitely recommend this product, it's a great, truly effective creme, and you can't really beat the price!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "for thos who want clear, smooth skin!", "unixReviewTime": 1343433600, "reviewTime": "07 28, 2012"}

At first, I was using it along with another product in the Alpha Hydrox line,Alpha Hydrox AHA Souffle 12% Glycolic AHA 1.6 oz (45 g), and experiencing problems--it turns out that I was sold a container of the Souffle that was actually several years old.  Whatever the cause, I stopped using the Souffle and have been using only the Enhanced Lotion alone for a few months now, and my skin is looking better than it has in years!!!First, a little background information about me.  I am currently in my early 40s.  As a teen, I had very oily skin but only mild acne problems.  In my late 20s/early 30s, however, I began to experience increasing issues with adult acne.  Although the problem wasn't severe, it was quite persistent and recurrent.  I actually went to two different dermatologists and tried various tropical and oral medications with little success.  (The only thing that really worked was Accutane, but that became WAY too cumbersome to continue to use given all of the requirements surrounding prescribing it.)After that, I experimented with using various over-the-counter products, always with mixed results.  More recently, I began doing some reading on alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs).  I did a lot of research of various products both here on Amazon and on the web site Makeup Alley, and after my failed experiment with the Alpha Hydrox Souffle mentioned above, I decided to try this product, the 10% Enhanced Lotion.  I am amazed by the results!  Within only a week or two of discontinuing the Souffle (which made my skin break out even worse) and using the Enhanced Lotion alone, my skin was MUCH clearer.Now, after using this product daily for about two months, my skin looks great: NO blemishes!  I do occasionally get a small pimple or two (usually around the same time in my menstrual cycle), but when that happens, they fade very quickly, leaving no scarring behind.  Also, I am starting to notice that the old acne scars I had from before I started using the Enhanced Lotion are FINALLY starting to fade as well--that is taking longer, but it IS happening.I use this product twice a day.  You only need a very small amount, as it is thin and spreads easily over the entire face.  At night, I will apply the product slightly more generously.  (It definitely does sting a bit; this occurs with all AHAs.  You can minimize this effect by applying less or trying a moisturizer on top.)  In the morning, I will use only a tiny amount of the product (or sometimes skip it altogether), and on top, I will use Olay Complete Lotion for Combination Skin with SPF 15 - 6 oz., which contains a beta-hydroxy acid (BHA; salicylic acid) and also SPF, which is important when using AHAs because of increased sun sensitivity.  This combination seems to be working well for me.  I haven't really needed much extra night-time moisturization given both that it is summer and that my skin tends to be more on the oily side anyway, but when I do, I have been usingSt. Ives Fresh Skin Collagen Elastin Facial Moisturizer 10 oz (283 g).I am thrilled to have found a skin care regime that is not only working for me but also consists of very affordable products.  Definitely, this Enhanced Lotion by Alpha Hydrox is the cornerstone of my routine, and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it highly!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "FINALLY a product to help with my adult acne!", "unixReviewTime": 1279843200, "reviewTime": "07 23, 2010"}

My face did sting for about 10 minutes, and then I applied heavy moisturizer over it, and the stinging sensation subsided.  I really liked the way my skin looked this morning.  It looked brighter, and my face had less redness.  I think I might be using too much of this product; a little goes a long way, and I usually apply about a dimes worth to my face and, and I feel it may be overkill.  I sort of like how it makes my skin red initially; it gives me some color, almost like I was in the sun, but a healthy color, not like Retin-A red, where it's splotchy and sickly looking.  I hope this product doesn't break my sensitive skin out, but I will update when more time has passed.  I'm using this on alternate days with Retin-A cream (both at night before bed), as I have read several places that these two products work well if you use them on alternate days.  I have very delicate skin, and I can only tolerate Retin-A twice a week, or I get a lot of irritation and redness (not cute redness either).I used to put lemon juice on my face a few times a week, and this AHA cream feels exactly how the lemon juice felt, so I wasn't alarmed.  Lemons work great, but they are sort of messy and gross, and I don't like the way it feels on my skin while I'm sleeping.  Lemons are incredible for brightening my complexion, but it appears that this AHA lotion has the same effect; yay! :)UPDATE: I have been using this now for a few weeks, and I really like the results.  I put it on after I wash my face at night, and then put a heavy moisturizing cream on after it.  My skin definitely looks brighter and makeup goes on much smoother.  Just make sure that you are exfoliating your skin by washing.  I wash twice a day, once in the morning in the shower, and then at night.

I started using the Acne.org regimen many years ago, and found that to be sufficient for the most part. Or, at the very least, I thought that my acne was just a fact of life and that The Regimen was the best I could do.About a year ago I bought this stuff and for some reason I never used it but once - maybe because it stung a little. But a month ago I had literally the worst acne flare-up I've had in years: something new every day, deep beneath the skin's surface, and it just wouldn't quit no matter what I did. I went searching online for more ideas, and to my surprise, found this on Acne.org's website with pretty unanimous acclaim (which is impressive since acne \"cures\" seem to be very hit-and-miss). Needless to say, I found my bottle and applied it to the affected areas over night. To my surprise, the very next morning things were looking up: the swollen areas of cystic acne looked somewhat \"deflated\", and places I could feel were about to erupt were no longer feeling that way. Over the next couple of days, the situation went from bad to nearly cured.Since then - about a month - I've had literally had my longest stretch of acne-free living that I can remember in years. I apply it to spots in the morning and leave it on all day, and apply it to my whole face at night. Of course, I always wear sunscreen now and have added a tiny bit of Jojoba oil to that to get totally moisturized and protected skin.I haven't even noticed but one or two little pimples try to pop up, and they literally seem to just fizzle and die after applying this stuff. Although all acne cures are likely to have different effects on different people, this has been such a miraculous change for me that I just have to recommend it. It's only $10, it lasts a good while, and it may have an incredible effect on your acne situation and your face's glow in general. In addition to being acne free, my scars also seem to be fading and my general skin tone is improved.10/10?

I knew from research that AHA's that had at least 10% Glycolic acid in them were supposed to even out your skin. I have always had great skin, never before had a dark spot or blemish. So I purchased this and used it after washing my face and appying Witch Hazel, (which I believe is the best thing you can put on your skin). I put a small amount of this AHA lotion all over my face and neck. I could not believe it, after only a few weeks using morning and night  the light brown spots were gone!  Since then I have never been without it, and although I am now  many years from that first bottle. I still have great skin, no spots and the only wrinkle I have is a line between my eyes, most people get two of them I have one!  But I attribute my great skin to good care and good genes but most of all to this Alpha Hydrox lotion.  It sometimes stings a bit after I have exfoliated my skin, but I have never had a bad reaction to it.  I get many compliments on my skin and I do not wear any makeup. I do use Ponds cold cream too.

Maybe it's age creeping up on me, or it's my endless washing of hands, but about a year ago I noticed I started to acquire those old-man hands with dried/parched skin, especially on the back of them. So I've been trying all kinds of cremes and lotions (go to my reviews page and see; I've reviewed some of what I've tried). A lot of them help, some more, some less, but amazingly, after all this effort, I was in a drugstore on an unrelated errand, and bought -- on impulse -- a jar of this thing here, Cetaphil. I'm not even sure why I did: I've never heard of it before, and I always look for the ingredients to be natural, w/o a chemical factory listed there. Well, to be fair, Cetaphil isn't bad -- no parabens, no fragrances, no colors. But otoh, it's got some chemistry in it though, alcohols and what not. Well, anyway, I got me a jar and tried: wow! It's perfect, better than everything I tried bevor, natural or not natural. It is:1. Bland and neutral (no smell whatsoever).2. Not greasy at all, not even initially.3. Thick but not hard to spread because it's somehow strangely slick, like frozen sour cream I'd imagine would be (except it's not frozen).4. Extremely effective: produces even-textured and even-coloured, supple and hydrated skin in one day; does not clog pores; skin stays hydrated at least a day; survives a handwash or even two somewhat (and then, it's easy to reapply if you need, 'cause unlike a lot of other things I tried, it doesn't smell and therefore can be used at the office w/o bothering anyone around).All my researches and expense, and the 100%-adequate answer was sitting on the shelf in my local drugstore (Walgreens, thirteen-ninety-nine a jar). Who would have known... and it's two to four times cheaper than other thing I tried. I also got the lotion, to compare. I like the creme better (it's more \"substantial\", persistent), but both are good though.Bottom line: Very highly recommended.PS. One thing I'd like to see that's not available is smaller (portable) packages. I can't go around with this bucket on me, it's too big: it's good for home, but I want a small dispenser in my briefcase. There was a small(er), 8 oz, bottle of lotion available there, but no cream in a small container. For now, I'm stuffing a small amount in a tiny tin from Burt's Bees Hand Salve, but it'd be nice if I didn't have to do that.Note 1: it's even cheaper in Wegman's (like ten bucks, +/-).", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Ideal", "unixReviewTime": 1319932800, "reviewTime": "10 30, 2011"}

{"reviewerID": "A37MH7ICH80QOX", "asin": "B000052YMR", "reviewerName": "Kate McMurry", "helpful": [13, 15], "reviewText": "Dermatologists everywhere, including my own, recommend this cream for patients with eczema. The main thing it has going for it is that it is very thick and it contains no fragrance. I've used this cream for years and have never developed any allergic reactions to it, even though several of its ingredients have the potential to cause allergic reactions in sensitive individuals.I decided tonight, for the first time ever, to analyze every one of the ingredients. It's disappointing to see that it has multiple undesirable ingredients thatCetaphil Lotionlacks. Perhaps the most worrisome ingredient in this skin cream is propylene glycol (see below).Ingredients: Water, petrolatum, glyceryl polymethacrylate, dicaprylyl ether, glycerin, dimethicone, glyceryl stearate, cetyl alcohol, Prunus amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond) oil, PEG-30 glyceryl stearate, tocopheryl acetate, benzyl alcohol, phenoxyethanol, sodium hydroxide, acrylates/C10-30 alkyl acrylate crosspolymer, dimethiconol, disodium EDTA, propylene glycol.Petrolatum: This lab-derived substance has been around since 1859 when chemist Robert Chesebrough developed a method of purifying a black gel that clogged oil rigs called \"rod wax.\" On the plus side, petrolatum seems to reduce water loss from the skin better than any other moisturizer currently known. It is also an effective topical barrier for preventing unwanted liquid substances from invading the skin. Premiere examples of the latter use are protecting the skin of babies and incontinent adults from excessive exposure to the ammonia and uric acid (not the same thing as urea) within urine and protecting the skin of serious swimmers from extensive exposure to chlorinated pool water. On the minus side, many consumers prefer not to use a substance derived from petrochemicals on their skin. In addition, as a continual source of moisturizing for the whole body, there is a big downside to petrolatum in that it does not allow the skin to adequately \"breathe.\" That is, it prohibits the skin from a normal, necessary function of absorbing moisture from the atmosphere. As a result, petrolatum can actually be less moisturizing over the long run than emollient substances that allow moisture exchange from the air.Glyceryl Polymethacrylate: This substance is used in cosmetics to hydrate the skin by increasing its ability to absorb moisture from the air. It is presumed to help heal and reconstruct the dermis layer of the skin and increase skin firmness because it contains elastin.Dicaprylyl ether: This is an oil derived from a plant, AKA dioctyl ether or Cetiol OE. It functions to condition and smooth the skin. It is a non-greasy emollient that spreads easily and is commonly used in non-irritating or \"sensitive\" skin-care products.Glycerin: Glycerin AKA glycerol and glycerine is commonly found in medical and cosmetic preparations. It is used to provide a smooth sensation and as a humectant. It is safe enough to be consumed internally.Dimethicone: AKA polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS): This is a lab-created polymer derived from silicon, a naturally occurring earth element. It is approved for internal and external use. Allergic reactions usually occur when exposed to this substance in the form of a powder. They include itchy, burning skin, hives, dermatitis, swelling of the mouth and breathing problems. Silicone derivatives act as anti-foaming agents and emollients. They make anything they are in more spreadable. They cause skin and hair to feel silky smooth. They create a protective barrier on the skin that acts as a water repellent, much like petrolatum. They can fill in fine lines on the skin and temporarily smooth out wrinkles.Glyceryl stearate: This ingredient is created in a lab by reacting glycerin with stearic acid (a fatty acid obtained from animal and vegetable fats and oils). It functions as a moisturizer, but it can be a skin irritant for people with sensitive skin.Cetyl alcohol: A fairly natural oil which is produced by hydrogenation of vegetable oils such as palm oil and coconut oil. It is used in cosmetics as an emollient, emulsifier or thickening agent in skin creams and lotions. In rare cases people with eczema find it a skin irritant, but that may be due to impurities in the cetyl alcohol rather than the cetyl alcohol itself.Prunus amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond) oil: Very safe, natural oil.PEG-30 glyceryl stearate: Emulsifying agent. It is a polyethylene glycol ether of glyceryl stearate which is generally considered safe.Tocopheryl acetate: This is a form of vitamin E, a safe preservative. It is generally healing to the skin, but some people can develop an allergy to it, resulting in skin rashes, especially around the eyes. In my own case, I am very allergic to pure vitamin E around my eyes, but I have never experienced any allergic reaction to Cetaphil Cream.Benzyl alcohol: This substance is used as a preservative in IV medication solutions and in cosmetics because of its bacteriostatic and antipruritic properties. It is considered very low risk. It is produced naturally by many plants and commonly found in fruits and teas. It is found in many essential oils, such as jasmine, hyacinth, and ylang-ylang.Phenoxyethanol: When information about the dangers of parabens became widely accepted, quite a few cosmetic companies switched to this preservative which initially seemed safe. Unfortunately, research has begun to reveal that it also may be toxic. Many people develop dermatitis from prolonged exposure to it. It can worsen skin conditions like eczema, and there is growing evidence that it may be a xenoestrogen like the parabens.Sodium hydroxide: Like potassium hydroxide, this is another name for lye. It is used in the paper and chemical industries, for the manufacture of sodium salts and detergents, for pH regulation, and in the production of aluminum. It is used to neutralize acids and increase the alkalinity of whatever it is in. I would presume that is the reason for its use in this product but--lye? Really?Acrylates/C10 30 alkyl acrylate crosspolymer: This is a lab-derived, white powder appearing in just about every topical cosmetic and medication on the market. It is also used in chewable and sublingual tablets. Though considered safe enough to consume internally, like Vitamin E, some people develop an allergic reaction with long-term use leading to rashes and swelling (dermatitis). So far, I've never personally developed an allergy to Cetaphil so, presumably, I'm not allergic to this ingredient.Dimethiconol: Similar to dimethicone (see above).Disodium EDTA: This compound is widely used in processed foods and beverages, cosmetics, contact solution and eye drops as a preservative and stabilizer in many processed foods and beverages. When combined with vitamin C and sodium bicarbonate (baking soda), it forms benzene, a dangerous carcinogen. This chemical reaction is most obvious when this compound is taken internally.Propylene glycol: This lab-derived compound is a form of mineral oil commonly used in brake and hydraulic fluid and in antifreeze. Cosmetic products employ it as a humescent, to prevent the escape of moisture from the skin. Unfortunately, the Material Safety Data Sheet of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) states that it is a strong skin irritant which can dry the skin. In addition, due to being absorbed into the blood stream through the skin, it can potentially cause kidney damage and liver abnormalities.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Widely recommended for soothing irritated skin", "unixReviewTime": 1359072000, "reviewTime": "01 25, 2013"}

It eliminates dry skin within a few hours. My friend who has to wash your hands eight times a day or so was struggling so much due this winter.

I use it on scratches that I get very easily during the winter, I use it after shaving, even to calm down the sunburn over aloe & vera.

I've always had pretty good skin, but now that I'm getting older I figured I should start really watching what I put (and don't put) on it. I read online (mostly Beautypedia) about the great effects of Retinol on the skin, so I began my search for a good Retinol product I could use at night. I have used products across all price ranges, but no matter how many high-end moisturizers/skincare products I try (I used to love Laura Mercier), I usually find myself coming back to Neutrogena products because they are well-priced (especially now that I'm on a student budget) and effective. I was very happy to discover that this product is rated a &#34;BEST&#34; on Beautypedia, and one of the cheapest of the kind.So far, I love how it feels on my skin. I have somewhat sensitive skin, so I prefer unscented products, which this one is.

I've got it all, plus super sensitive skin. I've been using this product during the day and even sometimes at night for a few weeks now with no irritation and great results. Some of my friends had mentioned another product that might be even better, so I briefly switched to RoC's Deep Wrinkle line. OMG. I only lasted two days using it because of the perfumes and the general heaviness/oiliness I experienced, not to mention it made my eyes water (and I didn't even put any around my eyes). I took those products back, needless to say. The grass is always greener--not.Neutrogena Healthy Skin is a great line in general. I now use the eye cream and the night creme as well as the day creme. I will stick with this line and not stray again. It goes on silky, no oily feel, no harsh perfumes, and no skin or eye irritation (and I use it around my eyes). I wake up looking a little brighter every day. Deeper smile lines and brow furrows are softening more and more, skin is more even and sun damage is lightening up. :)Love the line. Works for me.UPDATE APRIL 12, 2014 (I am now 52.5, fyi)Well, I have to admit, I've been lax about using my little best buddy face cream since I wrote my original review...To my dismay, at my skin check, my dermatologist asked me \"What are you doing differently since I saw you 6 months ago? Your skin looks more uneven, and I think you may even need a special cream for some developing actinic keratosis.\" (common rough patches from UV exposure that can lead to skin cancer). I freaked out a bit and thought immediately that about six months ago, I stopped using this cream...damn. I had moved and disrupted my routine, blah, blah, blah and thought that a couple of days wouldn't hurt me. Well, a couple of days turned into months...She told me that I could either go the prescription route that stings like an SOB and makes your face all red and weird for days....or I could go back to using the Neutrogena and STICK WITH IT.

The oil is quickly absorbed into the skin, almost nothing is left on the towel used to dry yourself. Once dry, your skin is silky smooth but not oily. The fragrance is delicate and clean and not cloying.I then apply a good moisturizer like(Olay Quench Body Lotion Extra Dry Skin - 20.2 Oz)to my hands, feet, elbows and any other area that I think could use a little more softening and smoothing.The oil and the moisturizer combine to form a moisture barrier on the skin that lasts and lasts. It's surprising to see how quickly the oil works! And how much more effective it is to use the after-bath oil than just an moisturizer by itself.This product is a good investment in your skin's health and appearance!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Permanent End to Dry Skin!

But this has a slightly different purpose; it's more of a dry skin treatment than a standard lotion-type moisturizer. I found that if I rubbed just a dab on the backs of my hands and on my nails where they can get a rough, ragged and chapped, it softened them up within a matter of a few days. And because it's a little thinner than vaseline, it rubs right in. If it leaves behind any residue, I haven't noticed. I also use it on other dry areas like my elbows and knees without concern that it will come off on my clothes.

With highly sensitive skin that is prone to break out for any reason under the sun, this product continues to get an A+ from me and from those in my family that use the product as well.**This item was pricey, but well worth every penny. First of all, this product is extremely thick so a little goes a very, very long way.This is an intensive lotion meant to treat dry skin and restore it to it's naturally soft condition. I found that it is best used at nighttime. I've tried using it with nighttime gloves, and that works well too. I just prefer to rub it on my hands and go to bed. The only reason that I didn't give it 5 stars is because I don't prefer to wear gloves at night, and because it takes time to absorb, you pretty much need the gloves so you don't chance getting the lotion on other things while it dries. I figured it out to be about 20 minutes before it fully absorbed, but I put on quite a bit!Because this takes longer to absorb, I wouldn't recommend using this as a daily lotion you might leave by the soap dish by the bathroom next to the sink.I use this daily, and because it's so concentrated, that's all I need to maintain smoother skin. It's no easy task when you have kids of your own and are around kids at a daycare where germs spread like the plague.

One tube lasts a long time because you use only a dab at a time. Don't over-apply!
