That way you know if you are able to learn from the software, before investing even more money into it. Since total immersion into another country to learn is not always an option, Rosetta Stone it the next best thing. While a class environment might work better for some, there's not always time for that either. Sometimes there's just enough time on the weekends, or in the evenings after work to get a few hours of studying in. Or maybe you just don't want to sit in a school like classroom, trying to learn from an instructor. That's where Rosetta Stone comes in.Rosetta Stone tries to be more than just a computer program. Instead it's interactive, and is a cross between software and an at-home classroom Spanish lesson. The software comes with a headset and microphone so that while you are learning, you also speak into the headset and respond to questions. The software helps one learn how to pronounce the words and practice what you've learned to help retain it. Unlike a classroom environment, you can work at this at your own pace, which I appreciate. When I took a Spanish class, some of the students flew ahead of me, while the rest of us were just trying to keep up. Rosetta Stone lets a person learn at the pace they learn at (fast or slow) so they don't end up missing anything along the way. I'm more comfortable learning from the program as well, than in front of a group of strangers .While going to France and living there for a while is probably the easiest and fastest way to learn French, Rosetta Stone is the next best thing, and a more realistic option for most people.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Suggest getting this 1 level at a time, so you know if you can learn from the program", "unixReviewTime": 1365465600, "reviewTime": "04 9, 2013"}

I researched this product a great deal before purchasing and even got the free demo CD first.  I really do like the learning process, it feels intuitive.  The problem is, sitting at my desktop computer is inconvenient and I do not have a laptop.  So when I learned that there is an \"App for that\", I was thrilled.  I own both an iPhone and an iPad so with the Rosetta Stone apps that link directly to my account I could learn and practice wherever I needed to.

I am very disappointed with Rosetta Stone and Amazon.  I did call Amazon but the rep I spoke to did not know whether the product info was written by Rosetta Stone or Amazon, I am sure it was the former.  Amazon did try to assist me by offering a partial refund but that was not really what I wanted.  I want to continue to learn on my iPad!

Learned that in the first 5 minutes. :)Ok, overall the program is good. This was my first experience with Rosetta Stone software and I like it. They really did one heck of a job making learning fun and easy. I highly recommend the software if you want to learn a second language, it looks like it is a good product. I would definitely try other languages after seeing just how easy it is to use this stuff.What didn't I like?For starters the headphones and microphone that came with it are NOT quality, they are not comfortable and my ears got really hot. It was like wearing styrofoam balls over my ear[...]. Sure wish they headphones were at least padded better. The microphone seemed to work well, my only gripe here is the comfort of wearing it. And if you follow this program you will wear it a lot!Second, it took nearly 30 minutes for me to install the software. I understand software piracy but between the lengthy install process, having to scratch off a 28 digit code from a little plastic card and manually enter that and the several updates I had to download it was a bit dull. I sure would have like a faster, easier program to install. So don't think you can just pop this in and you are good to go, you need to first install the application, then install the language pack, then update it (if updates are available) then you need to scratch off the secret code and activate the product, then you have to setup your user profile and THEN you can finally get started.Overall the product is good, I give it 4 stars out of 5 because the software is really the key here.

Aragonese, Aromanian, Arpitan, Asturian, Corsican, Emiliano-Romagnolo, Friulan, Galician, Ladino, Leonese, Lombard, Mirandese, Neapolitan, Occitan, Piedmontese, Romansh, Sardinian, Sicilian, Venetian and Walloon), only the major four (French, Spanish, Italian, and Portugese were attractive to me, but then I saw this offer from Rosetta Stone and I chose French.Learning French was easier than I thought.  Of course the grammar I learned in my four years studying Latin made French grammar easier.  Well, and I did get a French grammar text and a French dictionary, since Rosetta Level 1 is limited in grammar.  After a few months using the interactive program, I began to feel comfortable speaking the language.I was tempted to brag to my family that I now speak French, then I realized that I had yet to converse in French with another human.  Soon I remembered my years living in Germany.  I had studied German, but could not really have a meaningful conversation with a German.  When I said something in German, they would answer in English (somehow they knew I was an American).  Those who did not speak English (maybe one percent of those I encountered) used a different dialect, and I was back to using my German book and pointing to words.  The lesson for me is that now I must spend some time in France if I really want to learn the language.  Oh well, I can read French as long as people do not get technical.Recently I thought of a possible answer to the dilemma I have with my European friends.  I could learn to speak Walloon, Friulan, and Arpitan.  I am unlikely to encounter anyone who speaks those languages, so no one to question whether I really know it.

{"reviewerID": "A3I1BJIFFM4S21", "asin": "1617160377", "reviewerName": "Atomicwasteland", "helpful": [8, 8], "reviewText": "Never having studied Italian before, and never having used Rosetta Stone before, I was definitely excited to give it a go and find out what all the hype was about.I went through the whole lesson over the course of a couple of months, spending only about a day or two a week on it.In the end, I think it was a smart system, one that has specific advantages, but also marked disadvantages.POSITIVES:+++ IMMERSION TECHNIQUE -there is no English.  you will only see pictures and hear Italian.  This means you'll learn more effectively, as your brain is forced to make certain connections on its own.  Additionally, when you see pictures, for example, of a \"male\", the picture will be different each time: one time might be a young boy, and then it might be an old man, then a young man, and so on... and the first time you see the picture you might think it is a boy, but when the second picture pops up you realize that the word must mean something else, and you relate the two, and pick the commonality.  Anyway, this is a hard example, and it is simpler than this, but the idea is that you see different pictures representing each word, each time.++ WELL DESIGNED/VARIED -there are multiple modules which are scattered throughout -listening & comprehension, reading, pronunciation, typing, and so on.  It is impressive.++ GOOD REVIEWS -when I finished a section I was happy to find out that many of the concepts came back --not right away, but later when they weren't the freshest in my mind-- this meant I had to remember it, and basically memorized it through this recall.  I thought Rosetta Stone did a great job bringing up concepts and reminding me of the concepts later on.  I did not feel the need to review previous lessons...++ PAINLESS.  This system is about as fun (can I say that?) and as painless as a computer aided language learning system can get.NEGATIVES:--- PRICE, PRICE, PRICE -for most people the $200 cost for a single lesson (less as you buy more modules) is really too high.  Yes I know these things cost money, and I know they are better than other systems, but the pricing suggests that they are worried you won't like it, and you'll feel pressured to continue because you spent so much, OR, they are trying to convince you to pay only a few hundred more to get the whole set.  I'd argue they'd be better off dropping the price in half for the first module, and then I'd recommend it more.  (And give me some sort of discount if I buy lesson 2 separately.  I am not going to buy multiple modules without buying the first one, and testing it out.  $500 for the set is too much of a committment without giving it a shot first.)- READING EXERCISES ARE BUGGY SOMETIMES -I have spent 5 minutes (unsuccessfully) on several sections where I am supposed to say just one syllable, and the voice recognition system fails.  I mean, I KNOW what I am hearing, I have studied 4 languages, have good pronunciation, and I can't for the life of me get the computer to believe I said \"PO\" (for example) instead of something unrecognizable.  It was very frustrating, as I tried to enunciate it every way imaginable, with no luck.  Yet, when It was a multi-syllabic word (with the same syllable) the computer had no problem.- NO DICTIONARY -yes, I know this isn't part of their system, but it would have been nice to have a dictionary so that I could learn some additional words on my own.  (Sometimes you just don't want to wait to lesson 5 to learn numbers, for example...)But probably the biggest criticism is that this program is no substitute for classroom participation.  (Yes, I know that there are some online modules that you can pay more for, but I wasn't interested in paying any more...)My wife was taking classroom Italian at the same time I was doing this system, and we would compare experiences.  One thing I noticed is that the \"putting-sentences-together-on-my-own-and-saying-them\" part of Rosetta Stone, was one of the weaker sections.  She, on the other hand, got many opportunities to practice.  Mine was more about listening and comprehension.Overall, if classroom Italian really isn't an option for you, because you don't have the time or you just don't like classrooms, AND you have a lot of money to spend, then I'd say this is a good deal.  (If I were forced to move overseas I would definitely invest in the system.)But, if you are a starving student, then you're better off looking for other books and CDs from the library before trying this system.Recommended, but with reservations.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Nice system, but way too expensive.", "unixReviewTime": 1340150400, "reviewTime": "06 20, 2012"}

No, I can't say that after using the software for a week that I'm fluent in Italian, but I am making progress. It's a very comfortable way to learn the language, especially since it's self-paced and offers tools (the headset/microphone) to help out with pronunciation, a particular stumbling block for me.

Total install time with level 1 language pack was maybe 20 minutes or less (there is a lot of data copied to the PC).Launching the software was straightforward and launching into the first lesson was easy.

I was slightly disappointed that the headset headphones did not play the audio, and instead the computer speakers played the audio, so why do I need a headset for just the microphone?

He quickly picked up what he needed to do for each lesson, but as a downside many of the lessons show only four pictures, so you can just start clicking on boxes until you get it right (an issue for my son).One thing I appreciated is the first lesson had absolutely no English.  It was only images and Italian words and speaking.  This is a better way to learn to make the association of the foreign word to the object instead of translating it in your head through your native tongue first.Maybe being level 1 it is easier on me, but I found I could be pretty far off in pronunciation and it would still accept my spoken words.  However, it is still nice to have some feedback if what your saying is close to correct, and this software provides that.I think this software is excellent, but the price of entry is high.

Activation required 2 tries, but it appears the code is only valid for 3 months so I suspect online access may be terminated after 3 months but the software should still continue to work.The pace starts off slow, but within the early portion of Unit 1, the vocabulary starts to pick up rather quickly. Since I am not a language expert, I had a hard time keeping up initially because different tenses of words, or the plural, were thrown in. Rosetta Stone relies on photographs to help you out, which is quite useful but I could not get a good grasp of the language to actually use it in normal speech. Once you start getting used to the phrases, the software begins to kick it up by throwing in more words. Unfortunately, like other users, the phrases are too simple for use in everyday conversation.The Level 1 kit includes a USB headset with a microphone to allow you to speak the phrases using the built-in speech recognition.

It was the voice recognition I was leery of. Though I've studied two languages through classes, I have no aptitude for speaking languages at all. The languages I'm most familiar with are the Teutonic/Germanic gutteral sounding languages; I have such problems with the romance languages. I married into a Portuguese-American family and they still howl with laughter when, after 21 years, I attempt the language.In addition, I've broken my ear drums a couple times, and have suffered loss of hearing as a result (compounded, could be, by age!).I am very happy to say that I have had no problem hearing or understanding the Rosetta program.  The included headphone/microphone combo fits comfortably and I forget it's on while going through a lesson. In addition, I've only had a couple times where I had to repeat a phrase because it was so off-base the voice recognition program didn't think it would pass as Italian. Now, granted, this may be because the bar is set really low for how authentically I speak Italian; but I would think that with a program teaching Italian as a second language, it would have to be. For most people, it isn't teaching you how to pass as Italian, it's teaching you how to pass IN Italian. And, if the voice recognition program was too fussy, I would get discouraged and just throw it away.Lessons start out with pronunciation, one syllable at a time, spoken and written.  Then vocabulary, spoken and written. Then phrases.  Total immersion, everything is shown on the screen in Italian and spoken in the program in Italian. Occasionally, you have to type in the answer to a question, rather than say the answer.  Everything is accompanied by photos. So your learning is reinforced in three ways:  you hear the phrase spoken, you see the phrase written, and you see a photo illustrating each phrase (a boy running, boys running).  In later lessons you dive into conversations with full sentences.Your Main Menu shows you which lessons you've completed. Based on that, you can access Rosetta Studio, which is practice with real people. Your main menu will tell you if any Rosetta Studio sessions are available at any point in time. You schedule a session and you and other students take part in a session lead by a native Italian speaker.You get a two-disc CD set for additional practice when you're not on the computer. I have used mine in the car, only occasionally feeling silly for \"talking to myself\". There's no voice recognition, of course. You are only repeating what is said on the CD.  The CD is divided into the same chapters as in the computer program, and each chapter starts with pronunciation, then vocabulary and phrases. Good reinforcement, though, I have to concentrate so hard on what is being said on the CD, that it's a little distracting for driving.If you have an iPhone or another iTouch device, you can download a mini-version of the computer program, including photos. I haven't tried that as my phone is a dinosaur.Included with your program is three months access to Rosetta World OnLine. I haven't tried this yet. From what I understand, after you've completed each chapter on the computer program, you are told how many games, stories and activities are available to you on the OnLine center. You can play individual games, or games with other players (learners) logged in, or with a native Italian speaker. Unfortunately, Rosetta World OnLine is only available 8am - 8 pm for me in Pacific Standard Time zone.  Many times I've sat down at the computer after the kids are in bed, and then it's too late.  If you're in the Eastern U.S., it's available from 11 am to 11 pm. After the three month introductory offer is over, you pay a fee, but I actually can't find what the fee will be.Incidentally, Rosetta Stone offers a six-month unconditional money-back gurantee, but according to their website, you have to order it direct from Rosetta Stone.

They all seem to follow the same basic structure which I find to be very helpful in acquiring language skills, and in this case, the basics of Italian language.  I've always wanted to know more about the Italian language but am not motivated to try and become fluent.  Level One for me, is just right.  However, if you are wanting to learn Italian in depth please don't just purchase Level One since it only takes you through some basic elementary language skills.No English is spoken, only Italian and I'm given a lot of visual selections from which to choose the action that represents what I'm hearing in Italian.  I seem to do fairly well having both audio AND a visual component to learning a new language.  Also, I like being able to speak my new Italian words into the included microphone and have the program correct my speech mistakes.  I haven't tried the 3 month on-line service where you can speak with a native speaker (tutor), maybe I would if I were trying to learn the language on a deeper level, but for me I'm happy with just the program itself.  After the 3 months are over you have to pay a fee and I don't like paying fees.I feel fairly confident that anyone who applies themselves regularly to any Rosetta Stone language program will learn a lot of the language being studied.  I find it to be a very natural way to learn a language.  Of course it would be best to be totally immersed in the Italian culture to learn it, but for those of us who don't have that option I think Rosetta Stone does a good job as a cultural immersion substitute.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Rosetta Stone Italian Level 1", "unixReviewTime": 1303171200, "reviewTime": "04 19, 2011"}

This package is certainly unlike any other language learning program I have run across and even with brief usage, has yielded great results.  Although I have no major complaints with the program itself, the price factor did influence my rating.If you have issues with installing the software, I would check to make sure your pc has the latest version of software installed.  For example, Windows XP requires Service Pack 3 for this language software to work properly and Vista needs SP2.  It is easy enough to download the latest service pack with Windows but I hear mac users have more problems.  If you have an older pc, you really need to check the hardware requirements.  Also note that you must have broadband service to access all the features.The box includes a quick start booklet, installation cds, software cds, headset, user agreement booklet, keyboard stickers to convert for Italian usage and online services.  The quick start guide is important to read first and provides support online or by telephone (called about getting it onto my iPhone and received US based help without going through a phone maze).  The software installed easily on Windows 7 as did the included headset via usb port.  The global end user license agreement booklet was printed in microscopic print so I have my fingers crossed it is the usual stuff since I could not find a magnifying glass to read it. The stickers to place over the keyboard to convert it for Italian usage might prove problematic.  I had an extra keyboard that I placed the stickers on and could switch to when using this software.  I don't know if you would want this on your keyboard all the time and peeling it on and off does not seem ideal.  I think you could get away without using the stickers.This software helps with pronunciation (the headset has a microphone), builds vocabulary and phrases, and teaches simple conversation.  The software has 4 lessons in each unit covering: basics (unit 1), greetings and introduction (unit 2), work and school (unit 3) and shopping (unit 4).  Rosetta Stone advertises a learning application for your iPhone or iPod Touch but an account with Rosetta Stone's online services is required. Although the box states it includes free online features, they are free for three months only.  There is a $25 monthly fee  or a $149 fee for 15 months for online services after the trial period.  The 3 month trial starts the moment you activate your online account and you must be at least 13 to create an account.  I strongly suggest you use the software only and then use the online services to get the most out of this software.  The online services are great and allow you to access online tutors, games, and an online community to practice your Italian.  I really liked the options provided online but wished I had activated the free trial after I had gone through the lessons to get more out of it.  It's hard to converse or play simple games when you are just starting to learn Italian.Overall, this is a great tool to learn Italian if you can afford the hefty price tag.  For the same price you might be able to audit an Italian course at a local school but this software is more convenient and provides more personalized service.  Using this language software in tandem with its online services is almost as good as a private tutor at a lower cost.  I don't think I will continue with the online services given this is just a hobby for me but if you urgently needed to learn Italian, this would be worth the price.  I consider having friendly customer service available by phone a big plus.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "a great way to learn italian if you can afford it", "unixReviewTime": 1298419200, "reviewTime": "02 23, 2011"}

{"reviewerID": "A3MHGA6BJJ7P27", "asin": "1617160377", "reviewerName": "W. T. Hoffman \"artist and musician\"", "helpful": [9, 10], "reviewText": "ROSETTA STONE is famous for teaching language the way little children learn language...naturally, quickly, without studying verb declention charts, memorizing vocabulary lists, or navagating grammatical oddities. However, there is an obvious problem with this philosophy that ROSETTA STONE has based their teaching method upon. The people who buy and learn from ROSETTA STONE are NOT 3-5 year old children. Any Linguist will tell you, children are hard wired to learn grammer, and to speak perfectly their native language. As we age, the ability to speak certain sounds disappears, and the ability to learn certain types of grammer also disappears. Once a child is past that stage of absorbing grammerical rules naturally, or pronouncing certain native sounds, the door shuts. You can still learn, but not perfectly. This is why a russian who learns english, will NEVER understand exactly how to use definative articles. Also, this is why Russian constanant clusters are impossible to pronounce for English speakers. There are almost NO exceptions to this, except for language savants i suppose.However, as far as learning language in a natural way, on your own, ROSETTA STONE is the best you can do. As anyone knows who's studied foreign languages in high school or college, you start with learning to pronounce the alphabet. Then, you learn the most common words, along with the way basic verbs (TO BE, TO HAVE, TO KNOW, etc) are conjugated, how the nouns and adjectives interact, etc. ROSETTA STONE turns that learning process on its head, and the center of its do-it-yourself language class, is the SPEACH RECOGNITION system. The RS Kit comes with alphabet letters for your computer keyboard (in case your target language has a different alphabet, than the English alphabet), and the computer files, plus four CDs to pracitice pronounciation when away from the computer. Also, the buyer recieves in the box, this headset w/microphone that plugs into the USB port of your computer.(plus a few simple instructions to get started.) Unlike the oldest voice recognition programs from a decade ago, this headset just sets the volumn level, and you are ready to go. Instead of learning to pronounce the alphabet, you just learn to speak the first words a baby might speak...\"cat, run, read, boy, girl, hello, 1,2,3,4,5,6\", stuff like that. Rosetta Stone assumes you will learn the pronounciation rules automatically, \"BY EAR\". First, not everybody CAN learn strickly by ear. Some musicians can hear a song, and they KNOW every chord they heard, and the notes, and can reproduce them instantly, because they can PLAY MUSIC BY EAR. Other musicians need to learn what notes belong where on the instrument, and they need sheet music, and chord theory. WHY? Because some people are more right brain, others more left brain...maybe some people HEAR better, and others analyse better. So, if you are trying to pronounce the Italian word \"ZIA\" (Aunt), you will never GUESS it should sound like TSEE-ah. When English speakers see a \"Z\", they will not pronouce \"TS\", as in German, Russian, Italian, etc. SINCE ROSETTA STONE DOESNT TELL YOU WHAT THE ITALIAN \"Z\" OUGHT TO SOUND LIKE, you need to guess. THis is when the ROSETTA STONE voice recognition just doesnt work. You might hear TSEE-a, but if you see \"ZIA\", your brain will think it's hearing what it's used to hearing--\"ZEE-ah\", and that's what you will say. AND, the voice recognistion WONT recognise the correct pronounciation. Likewise, Italian has other sounds not at all like English, and unless you have some kind of heads up on how each letter SHOULD sound, you may never get close to the correct sound. I have a good ear. But i couldn't hear that Italian has a more dental sounding \"D\" than english. I didnt know the other oddities associated with pronouncing the Italian language. At times, I would click on LANGUAGE LAB, where you get directed to a page that SLOWS DOWN the pronounciation of the word, as well as showing you the voice print, and how the native speaker's voice rises and falls naturally, during the pronounciation of the word. (Apparently for correct stress.) If you are 50% or less away from getting it right, you see a brown cirle that tells you about how close you are, to correct pronounciation. (Plus the system records your attempt at pronouncing the word, so you can compair what you are saying, to that of a native speaker.) If your circle turns green, you are 80% or closer to perfect pronounciation. HOWEVER, this system DOES NOT ALWAYS WORK. Once, i tried to pronounce ARRIVIDERCI for 15 minutes. I was UPSET, then angry, then bored, and finally, dejected. Frustration kills motivation, and I think that's why problems with the voice recognition bothers so many people. IF i knew what was wrong with my pronounciation, at least i could TRY to figure out how to say it. I think this happens to EVERYBODY who uses Rosetta Stone at some point. The computer program doesnt say \"The Italian 'G' is PRONOUNCED HARDER THAN ENGLISH 'G'.\" Instead, you are suppose to just KNOW this.  Sometimes, i just believe the voice recognition is just not able to read normal variations in pronounciation correctly. For example, ROSETTA STONE wants you to roll your R's. But, very few people even in Italy can actually make that sound. So then the voice recognistion hears the lack of rolling R's as a mistake in pronounciation. The computer program considers these mistakes as WRONG on your part, and at times the mistakes start to stack up. IF you dont get thru a lesson with a good score, you'll need to repeat the lesson, and also repeat the offending word. (the program tracks a LOT of parameters, including how long its been since you have taken a lesson. Too long, and RS makes you review things before you can start the lessons again. But that's good.) All I can say, is when I could not pronounce a certain word, i almost never knew why. Even tho ROSETTA STONE gives you 4 CDs for pronounciation practice, if you've an inability to say a certain word, you might not ever speak it correctly.My other problem, was that there is NOTHING in the kit, that explains GRAMMER the way you learnt grammer in school. Sometimes, those photos that go with the spoken or written exercise, dont get the idea across very well. THE ONLY SOLLUTION, is to buy some kind of cheap TEACH YOURSELF ITALIAN paperback book, that covers basics of grammer, pronounciation, vocabulary, and all the other holes in the learning of the language, that ROSETTA STONES leaves untouced. AMAZON.COM sells a pretty good book, very cheap, that would help anyone using their ROSETTA STONE class immensely. \"ITALIAN MADE SIMPLE\" by Cristina Mazzoni, for around $8 new. I bought that book, and only then, were the grammer lessons beginning to make sense. ALSO, this book spends time in the beginning, to teach the differences between the way OUR alphabet is pronounced, and the way the Italian Alphabet is pronounced. You NEED to get a book like this, so you understand italian grammer, and have a little bit of an Italian dictionary as well.There are a few other problems with ROSETTA STONE. Everybody says \"DONT SIGN UP FOR LANGUAGE LAB, UNTIL YOU GET THRU THE LANGUAGE BASICS\". Because, depending on how fast, or slow, you are motivated to move thru the lessons, those 3 months of FREE LANGUAGE LAB go by really fast. WAIT TO SIGN UP! ALSO, its good to know that you cant just sign up for language lab a day or two before you want to use it. THERE IS A TWO WEEK WAIT, to have a lesson. Besides the speach recognition problem, and the lack of a good text book so you can learn grammer, pronounciation and vocabulary the way adults learn language, everything about ROSETTA STONE's classes are LOTS OF FUN. Really. They have games that help you keep those new words constantly in your mind. There are stories that help with reading, that are clued into your number of finished lessons. ITALIAN LEVEL ONE, for example, is divided into UNIT ONE, language basics, UNIT TWO, Greetings, UNIT THREE, Work and school, UNIT FOUR, shopping. By the time you finish that much of the course, you should be able to get around Italy, and make basic conversation. I would guess your proficiency level might be FIRST YEAR COLLEGE ITALIAN, or two years of high school italian, or 1-2 Italian grandparents. ROSETTA STONE is very visually interesting, and will keep you motivated once you get past that first unit (language basics), so long as you dont have major problems being understood by the voice recognition software. I wish i had waited for the langauge lab, because i'm SURE that would have helped. However, if you don't use it as much as you want after the first 3 months, its only $25 a month, for more time with those online tutors. All things considered, VOICE RECOGNITION really DOES work remarkably well. I'm sure most of the problems people have, come from their inablity to pronouce certain sounds specific to their target language, rather than the program's inability to understand your voice. If you are speaking the language correctly, I would guess anywhere from 96-99% of the time, ROSETTA STONE understands EXACTLY what you say. If some word (like my problem with ARRIVIDERCI) comes up, you can easily skip the word. There is NO OTHER SELF TAUGHT LANGUAGE CLASS that can perfect your speach, increase your vocabulary, and engage you in an \"immersion\" type language adventure, like ROSETTA STONE can.  NO OTHER SYSTEM has the native speaker 1 on 1 language lab. The only REAL problem is if you learn on your own, its hard to keep your motivation for learning high. You'll need discipline and some kind of reward, ie, a trip to Italy if you finish LEVEL 1? (Or maybe just a FELLINI film. Whatever rocks your boat.) Good luck with your language adventure, and ARRIVIDERCI!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The EXASPERATION of SPEACH RECOGNITION", "unixReviewTime": 1309305600, "reviewTime": "06 29, 2011"}

It has good to combat twice, multiple airborne jumps, and EVERYTHING! I had to replace the band once during this time (loctite my friends, loctite) and the battery just a few times. I am going back to Afghanistan in a few months and considered getting another Suunto, the Core, however, the reviews seemed pretty bad so I decided to get a new battery and keep the Vector. When I was stationed with the Special Forces, this watch was an issued time piece, and EVERYONE got one who was deploying to Afghanistan back then. I wasn't deploying at that time, so I purchased mine since everyone else had one. The face is large (52mm) and a majority of the painted numbers have rubbed off, however, the watch has never failed me. I seldom use the Compass or other functions, but when I did, they where dead on. Actually, one time flying on a mission I compared my ATLI reading with the planes instruments and it was dead on. Also, when I used the Compass for radio antenna set up, it was dead on as well. Actually, when doing land navigation testing, these watches aren't allowed because you have an advantage. In all, I have considered getting other Sports watches but this one has yet to let me down. When it does, I will stick with the Suunto Vector due to the lackluster reviews of the Suunto Core. The price has gone up since 2005, in which I paid $150.00 via an eBay sale, those days are apparently long gone. I've gone swiming, and even light diving and had no issues. The alarm works well, and the computer does all the fuzzy math so you don't have to worry about shorter months, leap years, blah blah blah. A solid product.

It's big, it's ugly, but has functions to make the fattest Swiss Army Knife sit in the corner sobbing in jealousy. Overall, I like it but there are a couple of things that sound better than they are.The timepiece: Outstanding. It has HH:MM:SS DD:MMM, of course, with a year setting to avoid leap year issues. This should go without saying in a modern digital watch. Stopwatch with lap function (not that I ever use the lap function, but I'm sure someone is interested). Countdown timer that can run up to a 24 hour countdown (very easy to set). Three daily alarms. Special kudos for the alarms, this is one of the loudest watch alarms I've heard, and I've missed too many watch alarms to not appreciate this.The Altimeter: largely eye candy, but kind of neat. Over four days, my bedroom went from 100m above sea level to 25 m below sea level (by the maps, about 40m ASL). Not surprising because it is driven by the barometer, and I never recalibrated it, but a graphic demonstration of the importance of calibrating it when you want/need it.The Barometer: Yup, it's a barometer. The part I like is the little display that shows the rising/falling trend, especially as this is always active (even in normal 'time' mode).The Thermometer: Take the watch off to get an accurate reading as the sensor is too close to the wrist.The compass: Easily the best 'special' feature. Accurate, precise (enough for orienteering, not for surveying), easy to use. It can be programmed for a declination, but knowing me, I'd forget to reset it, so I do declination the hard way. The sighting notches are small but servicable. The spirit level bubble is unique among digital watch compasses to Suunto, and greatly enhances accuracy and confidence in the compass. An outstanding wrist compass.The package: Big. Really, really big. But the controls are very easy to use and seem fairly resistant to accidental button pressing (a problem for me with other watches). The battery has a shortish (12-18 month) life, but has a hatch, so you don't need to take it to a jeweller to get it replaced without ruining the water resistance. The display has large characters and high contrast to the back ground, and the display light is just right, readible, even, and glare free, but not an emergency flashlight. Personally, I'm going to swap the resin band for a velcro strap, but the stock strap isn't bad, just not great.Overall, not a watch for the office or a suit but very good as a watch, compass and barometer, and about what you could expect as a thermometer and altimeter.

It is not very durable.  It isn't even glass.  It's made out of VERY easily scratched plastic.  I own several watches, and even the plain glass face models scratch at the drop of a hat, but this one takes it to a whole new level.  I'd be worried to sneeze too close for fear it may implode.#2 is the fact that despite the promises of being water resistent to 100 Meters (ie 300 feet) this watch isn't...FAR from it.  You are in danger of ruining this watch if you even enter a bathroom while someone ELSE is taking a hot shower.  The humidity alone may cause problems.  Pretty sad when a watch advertised as at the very least capable in a pool cannot honestly pull off a basic shower in a bathtub.Now, with that said, if you take care to avoid moisture whenever you can, the Vector is a fine wrist computer that works quite well in a variety of areas.  It'll tell you the temperature (under the right circumstances, of course), help you predict the weather, give you a bearing on where you need to go and then (after proper adjusting) tell you your altitude.  I found the altimeter to actually be rather accurate -- oh, and those reviews I have read on-and-off by folks bragging about telling the altitude INSIDE of a pressurized passenger plane are BOGUS.Considering what this watch can do, and it's limitations, I believe that the price is a bit high (you can buy a Casio watch that'll do the same thing--and is solar-powered, AND is REALLY water-resistent, all for LESS) but the Vector has one thing that not all Suunto watches, or altimeter/barometer/compass watches come with: that little bubble on the face which allows a more accurate determination of specific readings.  If Casio add's one to their model, I'll probably become a full-time convert.  If you are looking for something similar, but smaller, try looking at the Suunto Observer.  It's a dang-good-looking watch, but the price is considerably more, so that may be a rather important factor for you (I know it is for me).All in all, Suunto makes great products, but water resistent models are unfortunately NOT one of them (unless you are going for one of their products that actually are designed for underwater use).", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great watch that, despite promises, is NOT waterproof to 100m.", "unixReviewTime": 1175558400, "reviewTime": "04 3, 2007"}

First of all the visibility of the display is much too dark.  The images of the X-Lander on the Amazon and Suunto websites have been enhanced to the point that a case could be made for false advertising.  Secondly, the instructions to set the numeric values (meters vs feet, etc.) aren't even covered in the instructions that come with the watch, you have to download the full set of instructions to figure that out, then some of the fields used to set the values are so small and located in such bizarre locations, that even with 20/20 vision, I had to use an illuminated magnifying glass to see, then set the values.  Thirdly, the backlight feature is useless in low light or bright daylight.  It is only good for pitch black darkness...much too dim, but is probably the same as their military version, which has to be at a low level to keep the wearer from getting shot!  Fourth, (probably for the same reason) the alarm is not loud enough, especially if you are wearing the X-Lander under a couple of layers of clothing.  As others have stated, it should not be counted upon as a means to wake you from sleep.  Fifth, the barometric trend indicator is totally unreadable...too small and too dim to see under normal circumstances unless you also happen to be carrying a small foldout magnifying glass (which, as it turns out, I do carry while trekking).  Finally, the feature navigation is not intuitive, meaning if you do not use the features and sub-features regularly, good luck with remembering how some of the functions are accessed, and turned on and off, unless you carry the instructions on your person.I am going to keep this &#34;wrist computer&#34; for trekking, but it will not be the watch on my wrist for everyday casual use.

I mostly use mine to tell simple time, but I must say that as I drive over the mountains up to Montana or over to Oregon and Washington, it IS handy to know a few extra details just by looking down at my wrist.

I must say that I haven't been able to figure out the finer points of how to do that just yet, but I AM working on it.I guess if I HAD to point out one flaw, I would say that the night-glo feature it comes with isn't all that bright, and the alarm could stand to be louder -- but it IS about 5 TIMES more audible than the absolutely embarassing alarm built into the Observer.

I've scraped it across several hard objects, and it has yet to show scratches.  I love the compass and reverse display.  You have to be careful when setting up the watch, as it is easy to change the factory defaults on the barometer.  The elevation data seems to change constantly with barometric pressure, but I'm assuming that this is always the case with this type of instrument as its not tied to GPS.  My chief complaint is that the buckle is hard to unfasten (acutally, the tab that holds the end of the strap in place).", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great Compass Watch, So Far!", "unixReviewTime": 1241222400, "reviewTime": "05 2, 2009"}

It is by far the best watch I've ever had.  It is so light you don't feel it on.  It's great if you are a cyclist and want to reduce every once of weight on your bike. Quite literally, it is about 1/3 the weight of an average steel band watch. It has a sleek profile compared to most steel band watches so rarely gets snagged on things while doing work.  The face is also smaller than most  comparable watches.  About 1/2 way between a normal man's size watch and a womans watch.  I personally like the color of titanium over stainless steel and have received compliments on this watch for that reason.  It is fairly scratch resistant.  I am very abusive with my watches.  I wear them 24 hours a day even while working or in water.  I do a lot of hands on woodwork etc.  I've drug the face across some sharp metal stuff and this has put some light scratches on the face.  Under normal use I suspect it would not get too scratched up.  The band rarely comes unlatched even if you do happen to snag it on something.  The pins have never bent or come out, ever!  I think the titanium latch has better wear over stainless steel watch bands. The pins are probably also made of titanium.  It don't know for certain but given the fact they've never come out I assume so.  Titanium is much stronger than steel.  The band itself is very smooth and comfortable.  It never pinches the skin or feels irritating.  The reason why I have had 2 now instead of one is that I crashed on my road bike during a 30+ mph sprint and it was drug across 10 feet or more of pavement after an initial hard impact.  That broke the face of the watch and put some deep scratches into the titanium but the band never broke or came off.  The hands were still good.  If I remember correctly I think the watch was still working after all that until I started messing with the hands on it.  I paid $100 for it both times.  Now that I see they are a lot less on Amazon I think I'll buy another so if I eventually lose or break this one in maybe 10 years from now I'll have another to replace it.  You will not be disappointed if you buy this watch. You will seriously be saving money because it is nearly indestructible and you won't lose it if you never take it off because the band doesn't ever break or come off the watch.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Best watch I've ever owned", "unixReviewTime": 1196985600, "reviewTime": "12 7, 2007"}

Fong \"Serious Shoes\"", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "They say that \"it takes a real man to wear pink\", but even among women and girls who wear Converse, pink is an uncommon color. These make quite a statement no matter what crowd you run with. In some ways it can even be a safety measure, as they make you easy to identify in a multitide. Because they are so unique, people that wouldn't normally remember or even pay you a second glance will tend to look twice and/or learn to recognize you - I think that alone makes these worth the money compared to any other shoe.In addition, unlike many shoes, Converse don't mind being thrown in the washing machine for occasional cleaning (just avoid the bleach, or you'll fade them quite fast). Thus, I don't mind wearing these everywhere, because if they get dirty it's no big deal.Speaking of fading, pink Converse have to be worn for awhile before they resemble the color of the image shown - they are a bit more bright, deep pink than they appear. They are not \"neon pink\" (a separate and easily distinguished color), but nonetheless pinker than the image.Converse almost invariably seem to run a half size larger, and these are no exception. So if you're a 9.5, get a 9, etc. These were my very first pair, and I'm glad that I tried them on in a store to learn this before ordering - it would have been a rather unpleasant surprise.Also true to most Converse, these have little to no arch support, a thinner sole compared to most modern shoes (i.e. you'll feel it if you step on a rock or such), and don't take too kindly to being worn in the rain, mud, snow, etc. I certainly wouldn't run a mile or take a hike in them.

They are sturdy canvas that wears extremely well over time. The soles are rubber and glued. After extreme wear, some parts that are glued can get loosened. Shoe goo can be used to make most if not all repairs on these. So they can last longer than nearly any shoe. They make them exactly like they did decades ago, with the same quality, with one caveat, Converse, the iconic American shoes, are now made in China. This may or may not matter to you. It does matter to me, due to labor practices, and environmental standards, which is why I typically buy New Balance shoes, still made in the USA as of 2013. I've worn made in USA converse in the past, but never the new China-made ones. On arrival I couldn't tell any difference in the shoe itself, just as sturdy as ever.On a side note: This particular style is pretty trendy among celebrities. My wife saw this color/style on some female singer and had to have them. Lots of female celebrities buy these \"male\" high-tops. Which I find interesting, it doesn't look bad at all, but it definitely screams trendiness to me. You can google \"celebrity Converse\" to find pictures of the myriad of celebs who don Converse. If you do or do not want to be trendy, is your call, but these are definitely being revived in current \"pop culture\". To my wife, that is great, emulating her favorite artist, to me, I wouldn't be caught dead in them due to that reason alone. Although I thought about buying a matching pair just to confuse her, and be \"that\" weird matching couple, since pop culture has made them unisex lol.Hope that helps!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Long lasting", "unixReviewTime": 1377734400, "reviewTime": "08 29, 2013"}

It isn't for everybody. It's tight - a compression fit, the equivalent of wearing a pair of running tights, but on your upper body. Not everyone likes or is comfortable with this fit, and not everyone looks good in it.Having said all that, it's a high-quality, great-performing shirt. It provides a lot of muscle support, and wicks sweat from your body to keep you dry. As I said, not everyone will like the fit, especially at first, but the feeling does grow on you after a few wearings. Athletes in competitive team sports - football, hockey, etc. are probably a lot more used to the feeling and will definitely appreciate this shirt.The fact that you don't have a perfect body needn't intimidate you if you want to wear a shirt that provides a lot of support, regardless of what sport or workout you are into. In fact, if you're just a little bit soft, it does a nice job of pulling everything into place and holding it there - you might even be surprised how good it looks. You can always wear another shirt over it if you're self-conscious, just don't like how it looks on you, or haven't quite burned off enough fat yet. If you have a good physique, what can I say - you're going to look hot in this shirt. In fact, it's not unusual to see younger guys wearing it as a club shirt.I would not buy this shirt without trying it on first. I usually wear a size XL in the other, looser Under Armour shirts, but had to size up to XXL to be comfortable in these. They tend to ride up on the bottom or bunch up under the arms if you buy them too tight. I love this shirt in black, but there's a full palette of colors from which you can choose.The shirt requires a little more care - you can't just toss it in with the rest of the laundry. UA recommends hand-washing and drying on low heat, and people not willing to take the extra care have reported problems with the logos peeling off. I've not had this problem with any other UA shirts in the line-up, even when machine-washing in warm water and drying them in the dryer on low heat, but it may have something to do with the fabric in this particular shirt and how much it has to stretch (a lot!). Either way, I haven't taken any chances.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A Great Workout Shirt", "unixReviewTime": 1171324800, "reviewTime": "02 13, 2007"}

They had a quality product before the image was built.I stayed away at first, not thinking that an undershirt could be worth the twenty-five clams. I tried some of the competitors first, but a friend of mine was such an advocate I had to try at least one. I'm glad I did. The HeatGear material is perfect. It is firm enough that it does it job in compression -- for me, that means keeping my jiggly bits in place when I work out -- but it is not too tight or thick.I have both the sleeveless and the sleeved version. I like the sleeveless version for working out, because it helps your range of motion with your arms. The sleeved version is nice as an undershirt, but the only problem in that context is that they place their logo on the chest with a high contrast so it shines through the outer shirt. UA has started to offer a sleeved \"Tactical\" version of the shirt, which I might buy one or two, but the color choices are limited.They do what they advertise; the material spreads the sweat out and it evaporates faster than cotton.  The hold you in place.  You are not as hot as some may be while working hard.

Many products use double and triple D, so an F = DDD as well.

In this Enell Sport Bra I can run and jump with no unwanted movement.  It is a compreesion bra, so you are going to have a mono-boob, but it is the only bra I can run in that does the job without chafing.  And when I am working out hard I'm a make-upless, hair-puled-back, sweaty mess, so what do I care if I have one compressed motionless boob?Most of the negative reviews of this bra are folks who couldn't get into it, so I figured I wuld tell you the easiest way:1. First put your arms through the arm holes as though you were putting on a vest.2. Leave your boobs where they are: if they are down by your lower rib cage, your belly button or tucked into your waistband, just leave there.3. Grasp your Enell Sports Bra by the bottom two front clasps and lift up (vertically) so you are NOT pulling it across your boobs, but over the top of your boobs across your chest at arm pit height.4. Hook the bottom to clasps so that the bra is closed at the bottom but contains no boobs.5. Using your right hand, go through the inside of the bra and scoop up your left boob and pull it ino the bra.  Do the same with your left hand, right boob.6. Arrange your boobs so they are comfortable and facing the same direction, then easiely hook the rest of the clasps from the bottom up.Ta-Da!I will say this is a LOT of bra. If you are a cup size C or smaller this may not be the bra for you.  If you do not do a lot of high impact movements (running, jumping, karate, burpees, pogo-sticking) you probably do not need a bra this sturdy.  For example, I do not need to wear my Enell when I am weight training or biking.  However, if you are an older lady who maybe has had a couple of kids and gravity has done its thing, this may be the bra for you; or if you are a younger gal who is well endowed and have seen your mother naked and don't want the same fate to befall you, then you may want to wear a Enell to ward off the horrors of gravity for as long as possible.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "How to get into your Enell Sports Bra", "unixReviewTime": 1356393600, "reviewTime": "12 25, 2012"}

I'm glad I went with the 3, because if it were any tighter, and it would probably hurt my rib cage.  As it is, it seems just right.When I first put it on, I thought it wouldn't control bounce enough because it felt just a tad roomy in the top part, but it works!  There's still some movement, but it doesn't hurt at all, and I don't feel like the breath is being squeezed out of me.  In fact, I hardly feel constricted at all, other than in the band around my rib cage, and that part isn't uncomfortable at all. The top and bottom control panels do exactly what the video says--they minimize bounce. I did several jumping jacks without a problem.  It's really  hard to believe that it can do that without being squished too much.It does make you look a little like you're wearing body armor, and under a shirt it definitely doesn't look like you're wearing a normal bra.  But I think it looks fine. It just flattens you, and depending on the fabric you're wearing you can sometimes see the seam between the top part of the bra and the bottom support.

I remember walking at the track with a friend and trying to jog a bit during the straight stretches...only to have her comment that I really needed to wear a sportsbra to minimize all the bounce. She was shocked when I told her that I actually had two on. Since a pretty dramatic weight gain, the bounce has gotten worse. When I found out my job was sponsoring free zumba classes, I couldn't wait to enroll but felt self-conscious...plus jumping around without good support is very uncomfortable. So when I saw the Enell bra featured on a plus sized fashion blog (with rave reviews), I went ahead and splurged. I have to say that I'm very pleased.

And for the first time since I hit puberty I was able to go for a light jog without feeling like I was pulling a pectoral muscle. Also, because of the unique satin-like material (versus the traditional all-cotton sportsbras), my shirts don't ride up or get stuck on my chest like velcro.Still, I couldn't quite give it a perfect 5-star rating. For one thing, I'm still getting a little bit of a uni-boob. The band fits perfect but the cup size seems a tad small, but I don't want to go up a size and risk not getting a good fit around...speaking of which, it is a bit of an non-traditional fit. The shoulder straps are pretty short and sort of has the bra hiked up in the back...really high. Also, the price makes this a luxury item.

This is perfect. I work in a casual office and can carry this everywhere without worry that it won't be suitable. I have a smaller clutch that I use for occasions that call for more formal attire.While not one of those women who carries around everything but the kitchen sink, I am still amazed at how much I can fit into this bag. Everything that was in my regular purse fits in here, with room to spare. What's more, this bag is noticeably lighter than my purse, which is precisely what I needI agree with other reviewers that the inner water bottle holder is small. However, it does a great job of holding my sunglasses, which is more useful to me for daily use.The only negative is the small, narrow size of the two outer pockets. I love the magnetic closures, but the so-called cell phone pocket is too small for my iPhone with Otterbox case. Instead, I use it for my little pill container. I haven't put anything in the smaller side pocket; seems to small for most things.Other reviewers have rightly pointed out that this is NOT the classic bag, no matter what the advertisement says. It's the newer HBB-evo bag. That doesn't bother me, but it may bother someone else, so I think it's worth mentioning. If you look closely at the picture of the crimson bag, it shows only one flap pocket on the side. There are actually two.I guess I'm so impressed with the overall weight and function of this bag that the outer flap pocket design is really not a big deal. For an organized person like me who strongly believes there should be a place for everything and that everything should be in its place, this is almost perfect.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great alternative to everyday purse", "unixReviewTime": 1404259200, "reviewTime": "07 2, 2014"}

I have an Asus 1000he and have been having trouble finding a lightweight and attractive bag for it. The larger battery (9.5 hrs) makes it just a touch too big for most 10\" bags and sleeves out there.I can fit my netbook in its neoprene sleeve in the main section, portable DVD drive, portable HD, power brick and cords for them all. The outside pocket holds my wallet, Ipod, Iphone, pens and a small pad of paper. My plane ticket goes in the back zippered pocket. There are NO MAGNETS anywhere on this bag.The best part is when I want to travel light, I can take out the rest of the netbook accessories and the bag slims right down. Or I can use this as a lightweight crossbody bag that just happens to have my netbook in it. There is plenty of room for that and purse things.The vertical profile makes it easy to get the netbook in and out and redistributes the weight more ergonomically. Fully loaded, it feels much lighter than a similar horizontal bag. I love that this bag is lightweight to begin with, unlike specialized laptop bags that weigh more than the laptop itself empty!It is not meant to be a laptop bag, but the extra space in the bag enables you to add more padding and protection if you want to and still end up lighter when fully packed than an empty off-the-shelf Staples netbook bag. You'd be a lot more stylish too.The black, navy and slate colors are guy friendly and look like a cool and compact crossbody bag. The shoulder strap extends to comfortably fit a medium-build guy.

I think most women would need the Large/XL, even though it sounds big, I think it suit more people.Second, the right fit is important because if it's too tight, the part that grabs the back of your bra straps starts to cinch the strap, so you have two, tiny bunches by your shoulder blades that stick out like little bumps on your back.Finally, the clips do slip once in a while, so there is a chance they'll come undone. Then you'll have a swinging strap on your back.Again, I like the idea here, and it's better more often than not.

It will be after my own review.  I have worn these gowns for more than 20 years.  I used to purchase them at Dillard's Dept. Stores, but they quit selling them some years ago.  I was so happy to find them available here on Amazon because absolutely NOTHING I have found, for any amount of money, has been as nice as the Shadowline.  The pale pink, peach, and periwinkle are not quite as opaque as the other colors but I do not find anything unusual about that (think white pants!).  If you find the darker colors to be too revealing, you should probably consider flannel nightgowns. Just saying. :-)___________________Shoppers please note: There was a short period of time (late 2011) when Shadowline used a different fabric for the Petals gowns in Holly Red and Deep Lavender. It was not as nice as their traditional Opacitrique fabric. When they changed this in 2012 (and changed the color names to Red and Purple), the listings got mixed up here and were combined into the same page (for Purple and Deep Lavender). ALL of the new Petals gowns are made from the same fabric now, which is their trademarked Opacitrique fabric--the original Shadowline Petals fabric. The new owner is extremely picky about the quality of his products. And I believe the Deep Lavender and Purple are now the same gowns. If you have doubts, it is a simple matter to contact the seller of whichever size & color you are viewing and ask them whether it is Opacitrique fabric: select a size and color, then click on the seller's name that shows up. On the right side of the page, scroll down to the link that says Contact Seller.

I'll give it the benefit of the doubt and wash it a few times before I go to put it on again. I cannot wear it with t shirts or thin dresses because of this extra nipple room, and because it does create sort of a torpedo effect.

I use this bra for specific purpose in specific garments when I was to have a true shelf type bra that hold your breasts up and out. Wearing blouses or dressed, or even casual tank tops, can make the breasts look droopy and thereby making you stomach area look thicker, and your torso shorter.  With this bra, the band does most of the work holding up the breasts so that the stress is not felt exclusively at the shoulder straps. No the straps are no elastic and it isn't due to being cheap. the do the job of holding the breasts in perfect place and they have soft fabric under the strap which makes them very comfortable. The only discomfort you should feel is you choose the wrong size because they don't have a lot of &#34;give.&#34; They wear like iron and look great through many washes. I recommend never putting any bra through a dryer, nor using any fabric softener or high sudsing detergents that destroy the elastic. (sulfates causes sudsing) Try Charlie's Soap. You can purchase it through Earth Fare.  You will never regret it and it keeps the washer clean as a whistle, even the moving parts. What I also like about this bra is that there is no side breast because of the wonderful &#34;stays&#34; on either side of the bra. These push you side tissues towards the front. Just own it and throw your shoulders back and look great even if you aren't used to looking so good. You will be glad not to bounce all around if that is an issue for you i other bras. Don't let the less expensive price break distract you from getting this bra.

I wear a 30F or a 32DD, depending on the brand/style. This bra fits me perfectly on the smallest hooks. In the long run, that'll make it uncomfortable and big on me, but it's so awesome otherwise, I'm giving it five stars, especially considering the low price.Small band sizes are hard to find. I'm glad Bali makes some 32 bands. Most American companies do not, and those of us with the unfortunate combo of small band size/large cup size usually have to purchase very pricey European brands.  That's another reason I'm giving this bra five stars. I paid sixteen dollars and change for it. It fits as well (and is more comfortable) than most of my fancy high end bras. No, it isn't as pretty, but one does need some plain bras!Yes, this bra is truly old school. It's not stylish enough to be called \"retro.\" Has Bali been making this bra since the early 1960's? It looks like that might be true! Thing is, for those of us who are big and saggy, this shape can be very flattering. I'm a small gal with a big chest, and old school bras are really great for my shape. No, I wouldn't wear this under a tight t-shirt, but it's fabulous under any other clothes. I am surprised at how \"natural\" it looks with clothes on, 'cause it really gives one old school torpedo shapeOn to the scratchiness that so many are complaining about. Out of the package, this bra feels really fake and almost plastic-y. That sounds awful, doesn't it? Well, I don't find it scratchy on, and believe me, I am very, very sensitive. I'm always complaining about bras! This one is very comfortable! However, I would venture to guess that if it was too tight, it wouldn't be. The elastic seems less scratchy to me than many of my other bras, and this weird fabric actually feels quite good on. Another thing is the straps. Some have complained that they fall down. I am surprised by this, too, as I have very small sloping shoulders and I've found the straps stay up easily.Gals, get fitted. If you're wearing a bra that doesn't fit properly, you'll be making the straps too tight, and that's when they start falling down a lot. A bra in the right size is a must.

If you are full figured, you know what a problem it is to find a decently priced, well made, designer bra.  Bali is a name brand in this area, and their bras are excellent quality, and pricey.  To get this bra at $7.80, in white, including super saver shipping, is incredible; you cannnot even match this price at outlet stores.  I originally bought three of them about three weeks go, and they just arrived.  The sizing is true to other Bali bras I have purchased.  I just put one on, and it is wonderfully comfortable.  One particular feature that was not described on the web page, nor in reviews, is the back closure.  It was just what I wanted:  four hooks (vertical), in three separate sets (that means there are 12 separate hooks) for providing about one inch play in the width.  Again, this type of closure is difficult to find.  The only thing that I would have liked was some elastic on the straps; however, they do adjust in front to somewhat avoid cutting into the shoulder.  As of today, they are still at this ridiculous price, so I ordered three more.Next day note:  I wore the bra for over 10 hours yesterday, and it's the closest thing I've found to not wearing one at all.  To address concern in other reviews regarding the shaping, i.e., looking \"pointy\", yes, there is a bit of that.  For those who prefer form fitting clothing, this could be a problem.  This is not a minimizer bra; those will flatten you out if you prefer that look, but the price you pay is in comfort.  At my age, 62, I can tolerate the peaked look because it totally beats the saggy look.  I tend to wear my blouses and sweater tops very loose, so that this issue is not a problem for me.  At the very least, this bra is perfect for working in the garden, when I'm typically wearing an oversized T-shirt.  Another note regarding itching...mine do not, and I have pretty sensitive skin.  However, a suggestion would be to wash the bra first before wearing it the first time.May 28, 2014 update:  These bras wear and wash well.  To keep them in good shape, they are washed in a garment bag with the hooks clasped to prevent bending.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "To know Bali is to love it", "unixReviewTime": 1278460800, "reviewTime": "07 7, 2010"}

Mesmerized by their bust boosting miracle bras and fabulous looking models, I really never thought of straying. Problem was, their bras didn't fit me well, and definitely didn't provide me with the shape I desired. Their molded bras made me look saggy and lumpy, albeit bigger, but certainly not flattering. Plus, I was paying $40 to look this way, so I began to look for other options.Enter the Bali Flower Bra.....  excellent support for my small bust and a more natural and feminine shape. No longer do I have one single rounded lump for a bust line, but two shapely, lifted and separated breasts! Best &#34;perk&#34; of this bra, a slimmer looking figure. Turns out proper support really smooths things out and emphasizes the waist line... can't argue with that!!Now, at that other bra place, I generally wear a 34A but since that was not an option, I opted for a 32B and I'm glad I did. The tighter band is actually very comfortable and the cup is absolutely perfect (for once, with a little manipulation, I actually fully fill the cups!).Now, if you're a fan of the rounded molded cups, stretchy straps and a seamless appearance, this might not be the bra for you. But if you're looking for a classic, slightly more conical look, and solid support, this bra is perfect. For those who, like me, enjoy wearing vintage clothing, look no further this is the 40s or (less severe) 50s silhouette you are looking for.Finally, the lace. It's pretty, this is a pretty bra, but should you try it on straight out of the package and determine that it's a good fit but far too itchy, wash it once or twice--- you might change your mind.Very happy to find this bra, I certainly will be buying more.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Exactly What I've Been Looking For", "unixReviewTime": 1394150400, "reviewTime": "03 7, 2014"}

I got so many compliments on them when I took the babies out wearing these shoes. They really made an outfit seem so stylish.The shoes are a very soft material that will be pleasing to your baby. The soles are soft material, as well.  I found that these shoes are really best for pre walkers or indoor use while walking, otherwise they get really filthy because the material of the soles is white canvas type material that really shows dirt. I have thrown them in the washing machine but they don't get all of the stains out from walking and can look really dirty, which detracts from the look of the shoe. So, I liked them best when I just used them on the babies before they hit the walking stage. I also don't think that the bottom of these shoes grips well enough for a walker. If you want a pair of converse for a walker then I recommend getting the hard rubber soled converse which will not show dirt as much, and which grip the ground well.

It is a 36 B, and I pretty much fill it out. As others have mentioned, sheer bras are normally way too large in the cup, usually because they're stretchy. This is not stretchy through the cup, and I couldn't be happier. I'm built lanky: long arms and legs, broad shoulders, small boobs. This does not dig into me, and I don't find it to be itchy. This is working for me. I am so freaking glad it doesn't push my breasts together!!! All that does is make them look smaller, and, well....squished together. How that is supposed to help, I have no idea. Who ever thought that up? This allows them to sit a lot closer to where they want to sit (they tend to point outwards just a bit), however, it DOES GIVE SUPPORT. This is a small miracle. Hats off to Felina.

Of the various brands of bras I have tried, Felina is the only one that creates bras that will perform to the standard that a good fitting bra should on me: stay on with the central gore flush with the breastbone, cups around the breasts, and underwires against the ribs under the breasts WITHOUT the straps on shoulders or band fastened. Seriously, the only brand. They seem to have the perfect structure for people with large, firm, dense, close-set breasts on a narrow frame. I've been fond of various Felina bras in the past. Unfortunately, the cup fabric does not quite perform quite as well. Felina bras tend to expect the vertical center line of your breasts to be farther toward your armpits than they are on me. This seems really odd to me given how well the underwires fit and lay flat. It causes some sagging at the top of the cups and any seaming or cup fabric structure to not line up properly with the breasts. This particular bra has the added drawback of having weird fabric. It's a stretchy mesh with either lace or stitching of some sort in a lace-like pattern. The mesh stretches and conforms to your breasts while the lacy detail prevents the fabric from moving and conforming. Unless you're toting basketballs around, this causes some weird indentation effects where the lacy detail is.
